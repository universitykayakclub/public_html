	<li>Section 2: A group of non-voting members are club instructors. Instructors need not be enrolled students, faculty, or staff at the University of Washington. They are appointed by the Executive Committee to provide paddling instruction and promote safety in club activities. Their appointments are renewed each October.

	</ul> 
<h2>Article IV: Meetings</h2> 
	<ul>

	<li>Section 3: All meetings will be announced in advance through email distribution or posting on the club's web site.</li> 
	</ul>

	</ul> 
<h2>Article VI: Officers and Club Representatives</h2> 
	<ul>
	<li>Section 1: The officers of the club will be the president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, and equipment manager.</li>  <li>Section 2: The club must have five representatives that register with the Student Activities Office (SAO) by submitting their names, addresses, telephone numbers, and copies of student ID cards. The five club representatives must be regularly admitted and registered students. They collectively bear responsibility for club activities including unpaid debts billed to the club. Club representatives represent the club to the SAO. To satisfy the SAO requirement that students control the club, and at the same time provide the club with flexibility in electing officers, the club will use the following election procedure:  
		<ol>  
		<li>The five club officer positions of president, vice-president, treasurer, equipment manager, and secretary are elected at a club meeting held during the last two weeks of the spring quarter.</li>  
		<li>The president, vice-president, and treasurer must be students. These three officers must register as official club representatives with the SAO.</li>  
		<li>The officer positions of equipment manager and secretary may be filled by either student or non-student members. If students are elected, they must also register as official club representatives with the SAO.</li>  
		<li>If either the equipment manager or the secretary is a non-student (faculty, staff, or spouse), the new president will appoint one or two (however many are needed) student club members willing to serve as 'at-large' club representatives. At-large representatives assume the same bad debt responsibility as other club representatives, however they are not club officers and have neither the responsibilities nor the authority of club officers. At-large representatives must register as official club representatives with the SAO. If an at-large representative resigns before the end of his or her term, the president will appoint a replacement to serve the remainder of the term. In summary, a minimum of three of the club officer positions will be held by students, and there will be a maximum of two at-large student representatives. </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Section 3: The term of office for all officers and committee chairpersons will be from the spring quarter election meeting of one year to the spring quarter election meeting of thefollowing year. Any vacancies in the officer and committee chairmanship positions that  arise shall be filled to serve the remainder of the term by vote of the Executive  Committee.  
	<li>Section 4: The responsibilities of officers are as follows:
		<ol>
		<li>1. The President will preside over club meetings and coordinate club activities. The  president will be the official representative of the club and will delegate an  alternate only when absent or incapacitated for an extended period.</li>
		<li>2. The Vice-President of the club will assist the club president and assume the  president's powers and responsibilities when designated by the president. The  vice-president will be responsible for organizing pool sessions.</li>
		<li>3. The Treasurer will organize membership drives, coordinate purchases of club  equipment, maintain the Club's accounts and funds, and will assist the secretary in  preparing membership lists. The treasurer, in consultation with the Executive  Committee and the IMA Sports Club Coordinator, will also submit a budget  proposal to the Department of Intramural Activities.</li>
		<li>4. The Equipment Manager will supervise all construction, modification, and repair  of club equipment, organize work parties to build or repair boats and other club  equipment, and be responsible for safety at work parties. The equipment manager  will compile a priority boat use list based on work party participation. The  equipment manager will frequently make an inventory of club equipment and  immediately report missing club equipment to the president. In the event that  equipment is lost or suffers major or irreparable damage, the Executive  Committee will determine appropriate compensation from the responsible user. </li>
		<li>5. The Secretary will maintain and monitor the club's paperwork. This includes  providing a sufficient supply of forms for signing up new members and checking  out boats. The secretary will organize the filing system for membership forms  and assist the treasurer in entering new members into the club's database. The  secretary will also record and distribute minutes from club meetings. Finally, the  secretary will reserve rooms for the old and new members' meetings and place an  add in the UW's daily newspaper that announces the new members' meeting.</li>
