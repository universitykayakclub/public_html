			<h1>Trips, Classes &amp; Pool Sessions</h1>
			<h2>Instruction</h2>
			<p>Informal instruction and practice sessions are held at the Hec Edmunsen pool most Sunday mornings during Autumn, Winter, and Spring Quarters. Separate evening practice sessions on Lake Washington for whitewater paddling and sea kayaking are sometimes conducted when daylight permits during these three quarters.  During summer quarter, pool sessions move to Lake Washington.</p>
			<p>Clinics in whitewater racing, whitewater rescue techniques, sea kayak rescue techniques, and sea kayak trip planning are scheduled according to interest.  Most learning is done while on paddling trips, with experienced club members leading trips year round.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whitewater activity depends on river volumes, which in turn depend on rain.  Whitewater season generally runs from mid-fall through early summer, with both weekend and occasional weekday trips.</li>
				<li>Sea kayak trips are most common during the summer, as calm winds and good weather mean trips can safely be run nearly every weekend.  Occasional trips are held throughout the winter as well, but are more likely to be cancelled due to high winds.</li>
				<li>Kayak polo games are held weekly, sometimes more often.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The club maintains a library of books and videos.  A considerable amount of kayaking information is available on-line as well. Kent Ford's eSchool is one great source of information.  Visit the club's library for more information.</p>
			<p>We also have some video clips to illustrate basic paddling skills.</p>
			<h2><a name="pool_session"></a>Pool Sessions</h2>
			<p><img class="right" src="imagelib/class-pool.jpg" alt="UKC Pool Session">Pool sessions are an excellent opportunity for all kayakers to develop skills in the comfort of a heated swimming pool.  Pool sessions are typically run by a few advanced paddlers who teach skills, such as edging and bracing, to less experienced paddlers.  These sessions are a great opportunity to improve your kayaking ability and meet other club members.</p>
			<p>To attend a pool session meet at the WAC at the time listed on the <a href="/ukc">UKC calendar</a> to load boats and other equipment.  The sessions proper are held at the Hec Edmundson Pool and last about 2 hours in the pool.  Parking is available around the WAC or the Montlake parking lot North of the IMA.  As the number of boats taken to pool sessions usually matches the number of people who arrive on time to help load equipment, you may not get into a boat if you are late.  Priority is given to people who help with the transportation and cleaning of boats prior to the pool session.</p>
			<p>It is a good idea to bring a shirt that you do not mind getting wet, which will help keep you warmer in the water.  Goggles and noseplugs are also popular, as they keep water out of your eyes and sinuses, making learning hip snaps, bow rescues, bracing, and rolls more pleasant.</p>
			<p>Note: pool sessions are not held during final exam weeks or breaks.  Pool sessions are also occasionally cancelled due to special events which make accessing the WAC difficult.  During the summer, practice sessions are held on Lake Washington instead.  Check the <a href="/ukc">UKC calendar</a> for the most update information about scheduled pool and lake sessions.</p>

			<h2>Rescue Techniques</h2>
			<p>UKC members also schedule occasional practice sessions for river and sea kayak rescue techniques.  These will be announced when available.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in learning rescue skills, contact the whitewater or sea kayak tzar, as appropriate, via the club officers list.</p>
			<p><img class="right" src="imagelib/class-rescue.jpg" alt="UKC Rescue Class" />Note that successful completion of a sea kayak rescue course is <strong>required</strong> prior to participating in club sea kayaking trips on Puget Sound or other areas outside of the lake membership paddling area.  A sea rescue course is strongly recommended for taking sea kayaks out on the lakes as well, as having an understanding of how to get back into a boat after accidentally capsizing makes trips in rough water or substantial wind much safer.</p>
