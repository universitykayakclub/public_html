			<h1>UKC Listserv</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>If you have an e-mail account, and are a member of the club, you are eligible to use the UKC listserv lists. These have been set up to facilitate electronic mail communication between large segments of the club membership. When a mail message is sent to a list, (ukc-all, for example), the University's Listserv takes that message and automatically re-distributes it to everyone who is "subscribed" to the list.</p>
			<p>Presently the club has one list open to both UKC and non-UKC members:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ukc-polo@u.washington.edu -- for general announcements to people interested in kayak polo.</li>
				</ul>
			<p><em>Note: To subscribe to this list, please go to Subscribing to the ukc-polo list.</em></p>
	
			<p>There are also three lists that are open to all UKC members:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ukc-all@u.washington.edu -- for announcements of interest to all club members</li>
				<li>ukc-sea@u.washington.edu -- for general announcements to people interested in sea kayaking</li>
				<li>ukc-ww@u.washington.edu -- for general announcements to people interested in whitewater boating</li>
			</ul>
			<p><em>Note:  There is often confusion about the function of these lists.</em></p>
			<p>Three points should help clarify matters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Everyone is signed up automatically to the ukc-all, ukc-ww, and ukc-sea lists depending on the interests you checked when you fill out the membership information.  Please do not try to subscribe to these lists yourself.  If you have filled out the membership information and still are not on the list a week after you signed up, please contact ukc@u.washington.edu so the situation can be remedied.</li>
				<li>Every member is subscribed to ukc-all, so if you wish to send mail to the entire club membership, you should send your message to only this single list.</li>
				<li>Conversely, messages distributed to other lists (such as ukc-sea and ukc-ww) will not also be distributed to ukc-all. Only messages explicitly sent to ukc-all will be posted there.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The point of separate lists is to give people options for the type of content they receive, so they get a minimum of unwanted messages. If you only participate in sea kayaking, you likely do not want to hear about whitewater trip announcements, etc.</p>
			<p>Once you have subscribed to a list, you will receive all messages posted to it. In addition, you will be able to post your own messages. Ordinarily you will be replying to individuals, rather than replying to the entire readership of a list.</p>
			<p>Before you think of posting a message to one of the UKC lists, be sure you read the UKC's Listserver Use Guidelines. Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in loss of club privileges.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Additional club lists:</strong><br />
			These lists are used by members of the UKC Executive Committee, active trip coordinators, and web masters to discuss details of the club's operations. The traffic through these distributions can be high, and is not likely to be of interest to the general club membership. However, club members may wish to make use of these lists to pose a question to the appropriate groups indicated. You cannot self-subscribe to these lists, but if you are interested enough to care about minutiae of the club's operations, you should consider becoming a trip coordinator or a club officer. Recruiters (club officers, etc.) are waiting to hear from you!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>ukc-xcom@u.washington.edu -- used by members of the club's Executive Committee for discussion of general club operations.</li>
				<li>ukc-sfcom@u.washington.edu -- used by members of the club's Safety Committee for discussion and promotion of trip coordinators</li>
				<li>ukc-wwl@u.washington.edu -- used by members of the club safety committee and whitewater trip coordinators for detailed discussion of whitewater policies, equipment purchases, etc.</li>
				<li>ukc-skl@u.washington.edu -- used by members of the club safety committee and sea kayaking trip coordinators for detailed discussion of sea kayaking policies, equipment purchases, etc.</li>
				<li>ukc-web@u.washington.edu -- used by the club as a communication link to our web masters.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Unsubscribing from a list:</h2>
			<p>To unsubscribe from a Mailman mailing list at the UW, go to the list's information page at<br />
			<a href="http://mailman.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/ukc-xcom">http://mailman.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/ukc-xcom</a><br />

			</p>
			<p>If you are subscribed to the list with an @u.washington.edu address, use the "Log in" button to log in with your UW NetID.</p>
			<p>Under the list's "Subscribers" section you will see an "Unsubscribe or edit options" button next to which you can enter your email address. If you logged in with your UW NetID, your address should be filled in for you. Otherwise, enter the email address with which you are subscribed to the list and click on the button. This will take you to the list's "Membership Configuration" page where you can change your membership options, unsubscribe to the list, or request a password reminder.  By clicking on the "Unsubscribe" button, a confirmation message will be emailed to you. The message will have a URL that you can go to in order to complete the removal process. (There will also be instructions on how to confirm your unsubscribe request by email.)  This confirmation step ensures that you will not be removed from the list by someone other than yourself or the list owner.</p>
			<h2>Sending Messages to a List:</h2>
			<p>Once again, you should only rarely have reason to post messages to a list, since most communications are not appropriate for 100+ subscribers. Please read the Listserver Use Guidelines before you do this.</p>
			<p>To send a message to a list, simply address the message to the appropriate list. (Do not send the message to listproc@u.washington.edu.) For example, mail your messages to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ukc-all@u.washington.edu</li>
				<li>ukc-sea@u.washington.edu</li>
				<li>ukc-ww@u.washington.edu</li>
				<li>ukc-polo@u.washington.edu</li> 
			</ul>

			<h2>Listserv Use Guidelines:</h2>
			<p>University Kayak Club Electronic Mail Listserver Statement of Policy</p>
			<p>(latest rev.: 15 Dec. '94)</p>
			<p>The University Kayak Club (UKC) maintains an electronic mail (e-mail) listserver to facilitate communication among its members. This service is intended to be a high quality e-mail channel with content focused on the sports of whitewater kayaking, ocean kayaking, flatwater kayaking, and canoeing, and on the business of running the club.</p>
			<p>Messages posted to the UKC listserver by its subscribed users are unmoderated, and thus are transmitted as written. A large share of the club membership subscribes to each list, so any message going out may be sent to well over 100 people. For this reason it is important that all messages be to-the-point and fit the stated focus of a list. It is also important that most subscribers will want to see a given message. Historically, the main reason for club members removing themselves from our distribution lists has been 'too much junk mail'. If people unsubscribe, the lists will lose their usefulness.</p>
			<p>The UKC does not wish to 'police' anyone's use of the UKC lists (by establishing a moderator, for example), but rather, calls upon all members to be judicious about any postings they are contemplating. The hope is that if everyone uses common sense we will maintain a high quality of communications. However, in order to make things clear to everyone, we spell out guidelines below. Note that should complaints arise from the use of the lists, the UKC Executive Committee members will be forced to apply these guidelines as they see fit, and will take measures they deem appropriate to correct the problem. The gorey details follow. Please review them carefully.</p>
			<p>I. Acceptable Uses of the Listserver:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Announcements of official club trips.</li>
				<li>Announcements of personal boating trips, where the messages clearly state that these are unofficial, and that participants therefore will be unable to use club gear.</li>
				<li>Announcements of club events other than trips.</li>
				<li>Anything relevant to the business of operating the club.</li>
				<li>Anything relevant to the sports of whitewater kayaking, ocean kayaking, flatwater kayaking, canoeing, or kayak racing in any form.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>II. Uncceptable Uses of the Listserver:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mass-market commercial advertising (''spam''), even if it pertains to kayaking or canoeing.</li>
				<li>Anything with no clear relevance to any form of kayaking or canoeing, or to the business of operating the club.</li>
				<li>Anything of a personal nature that is not intended for sharing with every member of the club.</li>
				<li>Anything deemed an unacceptable use of C&C computers by the rules set forth for the use of these computers by C&C.</li>
				<li>Anything that could, in the opinion of the members of the Executive Committee, be deemed as harassing or insulting to members of the UKC.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>*If you wish to promote products or services to club members, send a message indicating this to ukc-xcom@u.washington.edu. If it seems to the Executive Committee that you have something people might reasonably be interested in, you may be provided the opportunity to make a one-time pitch to club members. This might consist of an invitation for individuals to sign themselves up for your own independent distribution list by which they might obtain additional information or offers.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right to use our own discretion in deciding the appropriateness of such messages, and are certain to favor the most restrictive options when considering commercial messages. There has been a strong, consistent sentiment expressed by club members against the use of the club's lists for non-club business or for matters of interest only to a small minority.</p>
			<p>III. Concerning Jokes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>While no one wishes to ban humor from the distribution lists altogether, it is quite possible that others will not share your particular sense of humor. Your favorite jokes should be shared between you and your own circle of friends, not with a large group of people you may know only causually. Should you inject humor into postings, do so sparingly and tastefully. Since 'tasteful' is in the eyes of the beholder, you should approach this issue conservatively.</li>
				<li>If a hundred people post their favorite jokes, we'll all be too busy hitting the delete key to go boating!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>IV. Consequences of Mis-Use of the Listerver:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Direct admonishment from a member of the Executive Committee and a request to use the lists only in an acceptable manner in the future.</li>
				<li>Removal of the privilege of access to the listserv lists.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The second stage of disciplinary action will be taken at the discretion of the Executive Committee, usually only after repeated misuse of the lists, and after the first stage has been applied. An exception for removal of privileges without the first stage may be made only in the case of offenses deemed egregious and willfully malicious.</p>
			<p>V. What to do if You Are Unhappy with the Quality of Discourse:</p>
			<p>Long time members who are familiar with the traditions of the club and with the historic uses of the Listserv lists will try to send gentle reminders when people stray from the intended purposes for these lists. However, if you still find that you tire of receiving mail from the listserver due to lack of interest or displeasure with the quality of the communication, your best option is to unsubscribe from the listserver.</p>
			<p>If you have a specific concern with the use or maintenance of the listserver that is not addressed by your unsubscribing, contact the members of the Executive Committee to discuss your concerns.</p>
			<p>VI. Summary:</p>
			<p>The UKC listserv lists are intended to be high quality communication channels which in nearly all cases provide subscribers with information they wish to receive, and which includes a minimum of content of interest only to a few readers. You are encouraged to use the listserver in this spirit.</p>
			<p>By continuing your subscription to the listserver, you agree to comply with these policy guidelines. </p>
