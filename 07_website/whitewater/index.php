			<h1>Whitewater Kayaking</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Although most trips take place close to home here in the Snohomish basin, trips to the Olympic Peninsula, Eastern Washington, and beyond regularly take place. Club trips take place throughout the year. Members have gone on week-long trips (Idaho's Middle Fork of the Salmon is popular for this) and have organized paddling excursions to Central and South America. We provide equal opportunities for beginners, intermediates, and experts. Club trips over the past year have featured river touring, play boating, and competitive slalom competition.</p>
			<p>It is difficult to make a river trip schedule because there is no way to predict water levels, however there are river trips most weekends and occasionally during the week. Many river trips are listed on the on the announcements page, or are announced through email using the UKC listserver. Normally Saturday trips are for experienced boaters and Sunday trips are for beginners and novices guided by river trip coordinators. The difficulty of the trip is determined by the ability of the group and the river flow levels. On Sundays, the choice of river is based on the interest expressed after pool session.</p>
			<p>River trips usually meet and leave from the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/southeast.html?WAC">WAC</a> on weekend mornings.</p>
			<p>Transportation is cooperative, and all riders should give the driver some gas money. Please do not wait for your driver to ask you for your contribution.</p>
			<p>In order for anyone to use UKC equipment on an off-campus trip it must meet the official trip guidelines, as described in the Club Constitution, Rules and Customs, and Safety Guidelines.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>At least one trip coordinator, pre-approved by the club Safety Committee for the level and type of trip considered, must be present.</li>
				<li>At least three club members (trip coordinator included) must participate.</li>
				<li>The trip must be to a location or stretch of river that has been pre-approved by the <a href="officers.php#safety">Safety Committee</a>.</li>
				<li>Participants must fill out a trip sheet (in the binder on the table in the clubroom) prior to leaving campus.</li>
				<li>Required equipment for river trips includes at least one each of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>first-aid kit</li>
						<li>break-down paddle</li>
						<li>throw rope</li>
					</ul>
