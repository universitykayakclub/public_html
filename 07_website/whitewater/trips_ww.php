			<h1>Whitewater Trips</h1>
			<h2>How to Organize</h2>
			<p>Since river trips are not organized weeks in advance, new whitewater boaters often express confusion about what they need to do to go on trips. Presently, there is no policy regarding the announcement of whitewater trips, and no one has succeeded in organizing a trip schedule. Therefore, it is up to individual boaters to instigate and arrange for trips on a trip-by-trip basis.</p>
			<p>Suppose you would like to go on a trip this coming weekend. You would need to contact trip coordinators to request that someone orchistrate it. (See River Trip Coordinators for a list of trip coordinators and e-mail address.) If you can get together a group of 3 or more boaters interested in going at a certain time, there is a good chance that someone will agree to a trip.</p>
			<p>Explicit Steps for Organizing a Trip:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First of all, you should be subscribed to the whitewater listserv list. If not, you may be missing announcements. See the <a href="listserv.php">listserv page</a> for more information about this. Also check the announcements sidebar for trip listings.</li>
				<li>4-5 days prior to your desired trip day, send a message to ukc-ww@u.washington.edu announcing that you would like to go on a trip. Give your preferred times and stretches of rivers (or your skill level, if you aren't sure). Important: Be sure to request that anyone else who is interested in participating reply to you only -- not to ukc-ww@u.washington.edu.</li>
				<li>If you get 2 or more boaters interested, send a message to the trip coordinators list, ukc-wwl@u.washington.edu, requesting that someone lead such a trip. Tell us who the other boaters are, as this will help us gauge the skill-level of the participants.</li>
				<li>If arrangements are made, and you and the trip coordinator deems it appropriate, announce the now-scheduled trip with a follow-up message to ukc-ww@u.washington.edu.</li>
				<li>Meet at the W.A.C. Go boating. Have a great time!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Important: Please refrain from requesting someone host a trip until you have at least one other boater committed to go.</p>
