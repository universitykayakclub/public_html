			<h1>Trip Rating Scale</h1>
			<p>The following is a trip rating scale used by the Washington Kayak Club's sea kayaking section to communicate the anticipated demands of a trip.</p>
			<p>Most club trips will not exceed the SK-IV classification on this scale. It is certain that there will be no club trips that would rate SK-VI. Ratings may be adjusted up or down by adding a + or - to the rating to indicate an intermediate difficulty level.</p>
			<p><em>Please know your abilities if you sign up for a trip rated SK-III or higher.</em> If you have <em>any</em> question about your capabilities, discuss them with an official UKC trip coordinator.</p>
			<p>To determine how fast your comfortable pace is, you can time yourself over the measured nautical mile course on the Evergreen Point floating bridge. It is indicated by round red-and-white markers near the ends of the floating part of the bridge on the <b>south</b> side. A green-and-white marker in the middle marks the half-mile point; it is near the draw-span. On the <b>north</b> side are two rectangular green-and-white marks separated by 2000 meters, a distance about 8% longer than the 1852 meters of the nautical mile. Unless you are looking for rough conditions, you should pick whichever side of the bridge is most protected. The conditions on the exposed side of the bridge can be unexpectedly rough due to wave reflection from the bridge. Caution is advised when the wind is blowing.</p>

				  <td>Conditions may require bracing skills. Previous assisted and self-rescue practice.</td>
				  <td>Conditions may require anticipatory leaning, reflexive bracing, using the paddle to stern rudder, and the ability to read moving water. Familiarity with charts and navigation is required.</td>
				  <td>Trip members must have tested their skill in rough conditions, know their limits, and be self-reliang in the even of separation from the group. Eskimo roll highly recommended or required.</td>

	<p><b>Paddling speed:</b> Trip announcements will include an estimate of the planned paddling speed for the trip. Slow = 1-2 knots; Medium = 2-3.5 knots; Fast = over 3.5 knots.</p>
	<p><b>Paddling Distance:</b> Trip announcements will include an estimate of the paddling distance, in nautical miles. Trips of over 5 nm in length require previous trip experience or permission of the trip coordinator. Participants are expected to be able to paddle the anticipated distance at the planned paddling speed.</p>
