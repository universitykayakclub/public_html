			<h1>Sea Kayaking</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Club sea kayak outings are generally scheduled in advance during Fall, Spring and Summer quarters. A mix of day trips, weekend outings, and longer trips are scheduled.</p>
			<p>You can learn about scheduled trips by visiting the announcements page, or through email using the UKC listserver. Other trips must be approved by the club president or the designated sea kayak officer in order for club members to reserve the equipment.</p>
			<p>In order for anyone to use UKC equipment on an off-campus trip it must meet the official trip guidelines, as described in the Club Constitution, Rules and Customs, and Safety Guidelines.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>At least one trip coordinator, pre-approved by the club Safety Committee for the level and type of trip considered, must be present.</li>
				<li>At least three club members (trip coordinator included) must participate.</li>
				<li>The trip must be to a location or stretch of river that has been pre-approved by the Safety Committee.</li>
				<li>Participants must fill out a trip sheet (in the binder on the table in the clubroom) prior to leaving campus.</li>
				<li>Required equipment for sea trips includes at least one each of the following:
				  <ul>
					<li>first-aid kit</li>
					<li>flares</li>
					<li>bilge pump</li>
					<li>throw rope</li>
				  </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Be sure to contact the listed trip coordinator(s) to reserve a space on any of the scheduled trips and to refer to the UKC Sea Kayak Trip Rating Scale for descriptions of the rating system used in the trip descriptions. You are responsible for understanding or finding out about trip ratings, and for evaluating your own ability to participate in a trip. Participation in a rescue session is required for trips rated at SK-II and above. We also strongly encourage everyone to become proficient in CPR.</p>
			<p>Due to the limited number of club boats it is MANDATORY that you contact the trip coordinator to assure yourself of a place on the trip. The trip coordinator will be able to answer any questions you may have about the adequacy of your paddling experience but you should know things like: "How far have you paddled in a day?" and " What is a comfortable paddling speed for you?" There is a sign on the bulletin board in club room that explains how to use the navigation buoys in Montlake Ship Canal to check your paddling speed or ask us to host a paddling speed workshop this summer.</p>
			<p>Sign ups within the first 48 hours will be given equal preference. The trip coordinators will give preference to those UKC members who did not get a slot on a beginning trip from the previous month's schedule. Ultimate selection of the members participating will be made by the trip coordinator who must balance the experience and paddling strength of the party for safety reasons. For SKI and SKII trips, every effort is made to accommodate as many new paddlers as possible, usually two thirds of the participants. For SKIII trips and above, trip coordinators will weigh participation in the sea kayak class or other equivalent experience, rescue practices, pool/lake sessions, and assistance at work parties.</p>
			<p>Transportation on sea trips is cooperative, and all riders should give the driver some gas money Because the amount depends on destination; ask the driver what she thinks is fair. Please do not wait for your driver to ask you for your contribution.</p>
			<p>If you are not sure about what you need to bring on a trip, you should check the list of stuff to <a href="seakayaking/bring_sea.php">bring on a sea trip</a>. </p>
