<h2><a name = "Constitution">Constitution of the University Kayak Club</a></h2>



<h3><a name = "article1">Article I: Name</a></h3>



<ul>

<li>The name of this organization will be <em>University Kayak Club.</em>

</ul>



<h3><a name = "article2">Article II: Purpose</a></h3>



<ul>

<li>Section 1: The purpose of this organization is to promote

    kayaking and canoeing. The club will (a) provide to

    members instruction in the safe use of both canoes and

    kayaks, (b) organize trips, and (c) assist individuals

    interested in competition.



<p>

<li>Section 2: The term 'kayaking and canoeing' as used in

    Section 1 refers to flatwater, whitewater, and ocean

    touring kayaking and canoeing.

</ul>





<h3><a name = "article3">Article III: Membership</a></h3>



<ul>

<li>Section 1: The voting membership will consist of regularly

	admitted and currently registered students of the University of 

	Washington.  Faculty and staff of the University of Washington, 

	spouses, domestic partners, and instructors comprise the non-voting 

	membership.  To be an active member (and thereby eligible to use club 

	equipment and facilities), a person must have paid required dues and 

	fees, signed a University of Washington waiver card, and successfully 

	performed a kayak swim test.  Membership expires at the end of

	the <a href = "#duesyear">dues year,</a>

	or at the time a 

	person ceases to be either a regularly enrolled student or a member of 

	the faculty or staff.  Spousal and domestic partner memberships expire 

	when the membership of the related student, faculty, or staff member 

	expires. 



<p>

<li>Section 2: A group of non-voting members is referred to as

    'instructors'. Instructors need not be enrolled students,

    faculty or staff at the University of Washington. They are

    appointed by the Executive Committee to provide paddling

    instruction and promote safety on river and ocean touring

    trips. Their appointments are renewed each October.

    Instructors have all the rights, privileges, and

    responsibilities of other non-voting members.

</ul>



<h3><a name = "article4">Article IV: Meetings</a></h3>



<ul>

<li>Section l: Four regular meetings will be held each academic

    year. The first three are held during the second week of

    the fall, winter, and spring quarters. The fourth is the

    officer election meeting held during the last two weeks of

    the spring quarter.



<p>

<li>Section 2: Special meetings may be called by the president

    upon five day notice.



<p>

<li>Section 3: All meetings will be announced in advance

    through a club newsletter, email distribution, or

	posting on the club's web site.

	

</ul>



<h3><a name = "article5">Article V: Dues and Fees</a></h3>



<ul>

<li>Section 1: The <a name = "duesyear">dues year</a>

    will run from the first day of

    autumn quarter of the academic year to the last day of October 

	in fall quarter of the following academic year.



<p>

<li>Section 2: Club dues rules will be announced at the fall

    quarter meeting for the coming academic year.



<p>

<li>Section 3: Faculty, staff, spouses, and domestic partners may be asked

	to pay a Waterfront Activities Center (WAC) "quarterly use fee" above 

	any regular club dues assessment.



</ul>



<h3><a name = "article6">Article VI: Officers and Club Representatives</a></h3>



<ul>

<li>Section 1: The officers of the club will be the president,

    vice-president, treasurer, secretary, and equipment

    manager.



<p>

<li>Section 2: The club must have five representatives

    that register with the Student Activies Office (SAO) by

    submitting their names, addresses, telephone numbers, and

    copies of student ID cards. The five club representatives

    must be regularly admitted and registered students. They

    collectively bear responsibility for club activities

    including unpaid debts billed to the club. Club

    representatives represent the club to the SAO.



    <p>

    To satisfy the SAO requirement that 

    students control the club, and at the same time provide

    the club with flexibility in electing officers, the club

    will use the following election procedure:



    <p>

    <OL>

    <LI>The five club officer positions of president,

        vice-president, treasurer, equipment manager and

        secretary are elected at a club meeting held during

        the last two weeks of the spring quarter.



    <p>

    <LI>The president, vice-president, and treasurer must be students. These

		three officers must register as official club representatives with 

		the SAO.



    <p>

    <LI>The officer positions of equipment manager and

        secretary may be filled by either student or

        nonstudent members. If students are elected, they

        must also register as offical club representatives

        with the SAO. 

		

	<p>

	<LI>If either the equipment manager or the

		secretary is a non-student (faculty, staff, or spouse), the new 

		president will appoint one or two (however many are needed) student 

		club members willing to serve as 'at-large' club representatives.  

		At-large representatives assume the same bad debt responsibility as 

		other club representatives, however they are not club officers and 

		have neither the responsibilities nor the authority of club 

		officers.  At-large representatives must register as offical club 

		representatives with the SAO. If an at-large representative resigns 

		before the end of his or her term, the president will appoint a 

		replacement to serve the remainder of the term.



    </OL>



    <p>

    In summary, a minimum of three of the club officer

    positions will be held by students, and there will

	be a maximum of two at-large student representatives.

        incapacitated for an extended period.



    <p>

    <LI>The <em>Vice-President</em> of the club will assist the

        construction, modification, and repair of club

        equipment, organize work parties to build or repair

        for safety at work parties. The equipment manager

        will compile a priority boat use list based on work

        party participation. The equipment manager will

        frequently make an inventory of club equipment and

        immediately report missing club equipment to the

        president. In the event that equipment is lost or

        suffers major or irreparable damage, the Executive

        Committee will determine appropriate compensation

        from the responsible user.



	<p>

	<LI>The <em>Secretary</em> will maintain and monitor

		the club's paperwork.  This includes providing a sufficient supply 

		of forms for signing up new members and checking out boats.  The 

		secretary will organize the filing system for membership forms and 

		assist the treasurer in entering new members into the club's 

		database.  The secretary will also record and distribute minutes 

		from club meetings.  Finally, the secretary will reserve rooms for 

		the old and new members' meetings and place an add in the UW's 

		daily newspaper that announces the new members' meeting.
