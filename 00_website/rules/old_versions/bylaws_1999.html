<h2>Bylaws of the University Kayak Club</h2>



<P>

<h3><A NAME = "I-Membership">I. Membership</a></h3>



<P>

Registered students, faculty, staff, and their spouses are

eligible for club membership. Only students are eligible for

voting membership.



<P>

Membership expires at the first meeting of the fall quarter or

at the time a person is no longer eligible for membership.

Spousal memberships expire when the membership of the related

club member expires.



<P>

'Instructor' memberships are provided to individuals who are not

eligible to join but whose presence on river trips enhances

paddling education and safety. Instructor memberships will be

designated by the club executive board with an updated list

publicized each October.



<P>

To be an active member a person must:



<OL>

  <LI>pay required dues and fees,

  <LI>successfully demonstrate a kayak wet exit and tow,

  <LI>fill out and sign a University of Washington waiver

      card, and

  <LI>fill out a University Kayak Club information sheet.



</OL>





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "II-Dues">II. Dues and Fees</a></h3>



<P>

Definitions:



<OL>

  <LI>LAKE Membership: These members can use club equipment

      only on Lake Washington (hereafter taken to mean the

      Arboretum area of Lake Washington west of the Webster

      Point buoy to Ballard locks.)



  <LI>RIVER Membership: These members can use club equipment

      on rivers and on flat water other than Lake Washington. 

      "Other flat water" includes Puget Sound. Use of the Club's

      ocean touring kayaks requires a RIVER membership when not

      paddling on Lake Washington.



  <LI>SELF-SUFFICIENT Membership: These members cannot use club

      equipment. Pool session privileges are the principle benefit

</OL>



<P>

The 1998-99 dues schedule is:



<P>



<table noborder>

<tr><td width=26></td><td>Membership Type</td><td>Dues</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>Lake</td><td align = "right">$20</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>River</td><td align = "right">$40</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>Self-sufficient</td><td align = "right">$5</td></tr>

</table>





<P>

The above dues payments apply regardless of when during the

academic year an individual becomes a member. Thus, membership

fees are like annual fishing licenses where the price is the

same whether 365 days are left in the season or one day is left

in the season.



<P>

Club ID cards are color coded to indicate the type of

membership. ID cards are to be shown to office personnel at

the Waterfront Activities Center (WAC) when signing out the

club boathouse key and club equipment. ID cards will be

provided to new members only after they have successfully 

demonstrated a kayak wet exit and tow to a club officer.



<P>

Membership forms may be completed and dues may be paid during

normal business hours at the WAC and at the HUB information

desk. Dues and membership forms are also collected by the club

treasurer at the autumn quarter meeting and at the first

several pool sessions of the autumn quarter.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "III-Officers">III. Officers and Club Representatives</a></h3>



<P>

The officers of the club are the president, vice-president,

treasurer, secretary, and equipment manager. (See the

<a href="rules/constitution.html">Club

Constitution</a>



for information on members who serve as 'club

representatives' to the Student Activities Office).



<P>

Club officers are elected at a meeting held at the end of each

spring quarter. The term of office for all officers and

committee chairpersons will be from the spring quarter election

meeting of one year to the spring quarter election meeting of

the following year. Any vacancies in the officer and committee

chairmanship positions that arise will be filled to serve the

remainder of-the term by vote of the executive board.



<P>

The club executive board may appoint members to serve as

'beginner trip coordinator,' 'environmental affairs

chairperson,' 'safety instructor,' 'canoe chairperson,'

'racing committee chairperson,' and other ad hoc positions.



<P>

Each fall, the safety committee will draw up a list of ocean

touring trip coordinators and whitewater trip coordinators for Class II,

III, and IV water. Also at this time, the club executive

committee will designate individuals that will receive

instructor status memberships.



<P>

<h3><A NAME = "IV-Meetings">IV. Club Meetings</a></h3>



<P>

Unless other arrangements are announced in it club newsletter,

club meetings will be held the evening of the second Thursday of

each quarter in the upstairs meeting rooms of the Waterfront

Activities Center (WAC). Often these meetings include potluck

suppers, slide and videotape shows, and other presentations.

The final club meeting of the academic year is the election

meeting held during the last two weeks of the spring quarter.

Newsletters will announce all club meetings.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "V-PoolSessions">V. Pool Sessions and Beginner Trips</a></h3>



<P>

Pool sessions will be held at the Hec Edmundson Pavilion pool

each Sunday morning 9:00 am to 11:00 am during the fall through

spring quarters. Pool sessions will not usually be scheduled

during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Spring breaks. Typically,

there are a few Sundays each quarter when other users of the

pool preempt UKC use. When this happens, the preempted dates

will be announced with a note on the bulletin board on the

clubhouse door.



<P>

Only members may attend pool sessions, and those doing so are

expected to arrive at the WAC boathouse at 8:30 am on Sunday to

help transport boats to the pool. (Those who own their own

boats may go directly to the Hec Ed Pool. However, if they have

room on their roof racks, it would be helpful for these members

to stop off at the boathouse to pick up a few boats before they

go to the pool.)



<P>

Boats have to be rinsed out thoroughly (float bags removed)

outside the pool building before bringing the boats inside to

the pool. Care must be taken in moving boats into and out of

the pool building to avoid damaging benches and tiles. When

paddling in goe pool, avoid sharp blows with your bow or stern

and the sides of the pool. At one time tennis ball halves were taped

to the bow and stern points of boats. Because the damaged

tennis balls would often fill up with dirt that was difficult

to rinse out, however, this practice was discontinued.



<P>

Beginner trips usually follow Sunday morning pool sessions. By

custom, beginner trip coordinators do not pay transportation costs to

and from the river.



<P>

The club vice-president is responsible for organizing pool

sessions and making arrangements for beginner trip coordinators.

The vice-president will also organize safety instruction, part

of which will take place at pool sessions.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "VI-NewMember">VI. New Member Kayak Wet Exit and Tow</a></h3>



<P>

All new members are required to demonstrate a kayak wet exit and tow

prior to use of club equipment on any body of water. This test

is given at the first pool session of the fall quarter and other

pool sessions as needed. Other arrangements can be made by

contacting the club vice-president.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "VII-ThreePersonRule">VII. Three Members Per Trip</a></h3>



<P>

At least three club members must be a part of any club river

trip. Further, club equipment can only be used on club trips.

The most important exception to this rule is when someone is

participating in a slalom race, slalom race practice, or

whitewater rodeo where other paddlers will be present. Such an

exception is made on a case by case, prior approval basis by the

club president. The three club member rule does not apply to

paddling on Lake Washington. However, the three club member

rule does apply for all ocean touring and other flat water

paddling on water other than Lake Washington. (For other rules

governing the use of the Club's ocean touring boats, see

<a href = "#XII-OtherRestrictions">XII-B</a>

below and also Section VI of the the 

<a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a> on ocean touring safety rules.)





<h3>

<A NAME = "VIII-Restrictions">VIII. Restrictions on the Use of Club Equipment:<br>

     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClass Of Whitewater and Duration of Trip

</a></h3>



<P>

Club trips, and thus the use of club boats and other  equipment,

are restricted to rivers listed as 'permitted' under Section

VII of the document titled 

<a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>. The  water flow

limits specified in the 'Permitted Rivers List' further

constrain the choice of rivers for a club trip. Note  that  club

equipment use on Class IV water is limited to a few runs and

Class V use is not permitted.  (See the

<a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a> for

other rules concerning trip coordinators responsibilites and  required

safet  rocedures and safett  equipment.





<P>

Boat use is permitted on multiday  club  trips  of  more  than  three

days and to rivers that are not named  on  the  'Permitted  Rivers

List' only with the approval  of  the  club  president  or  equipment

manager.  Such decisions will be made  on  a  case-by-case,  prior

approval basis.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "IX-Safety">IX. Safety</a></h3>



<P>

Details concerning safety are described in the 

<a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>.  Key safety rules include:



<OL>

  <LI> Every trip must be conducted by a designated trip coordinator who

     has previously run the river and is approved for the class

     of water expected. See the Trip Coordinator List described in the

     <a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

	 Guidelines</a>. The trip coordinator and other trip members

     must be listed on the 'trip sheet' filed in a notebook in

     the boathouse (see <a href = "#X-EquipmentSignOut">Section X</a>, below).



  <LI> Checking the river level (cubic  feet  per  second  flpw

     rate) is a must before each trip. Make a phone call on

     the whitewater Hot Line for local river runs (526-8530).



  <LI> A break-down paddle, two throw ropes, and a first aid

     kit should be brought on every river trip. A special trip

     pack is required for ocean touring, and this is descibed in

     Section VI of the 

     <a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

	 Guidelines</a>. Every club member

     on a trip must have a helmet, life jacket, and spray

     skirt. A wet suit or dry suit is usually required,

     although this may not be necessary in the summer on some

     rivers.



  <LI> If a trip coordinator deems a person's equipment

     insufficient or unsafe, or a person's paddling skills

     inadequate for a particular run, the trip coordinato may

     refuse to allow that person to  participate  or  continue  on

     a river trip.  The trip coordinator's decision is final.



</OL>

<P>

The club vice-president will organize pool and on-river

instruction sessions in basic rescue  and  first  aid  techniques.

Instruction in reading water,  paddling  technique,  and  avoiding

and coping with hazardous obstacles  and  hydraulics  will  also

be organized-by the vice-president.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "X-EquipmentSignOut">X. Signing Out Equipment</a></h3>



<P>

Club equipment used on Lake Washington must  be  signed  out  by

completely filling out a 'yellow  card'  listing  all  equipment  by

number where possible.



<P>

Yellow cards for Lake Washington paddling are obtained and

filed with the WAC office.  For river trips and all other

paddling yellow cards needn't be filled out but 'trip sheets',

must be.  Trip sheets contain the same information as the

yellow cards and are filed in a notebook in the boathouse.



<P>

Both yellow cards and trip sheets contain statements obligating

users to compensate the club for the replacement and repair  of

lost or damaged equipment, or to perform acceptable repairs

themselves.  The equipment manager will be the judge of what

repair work is acceptable to the degree that compensation isn't

required.  Members may appeal the decision of the equipment

manager to the executive board.  The executive board will

determine the amount of compensation if necessary.



<P>

Yellow cards and trip sheets will be used to determine  who  is

responsible for lost or damaged equipment. An honor  system  of

self-reporting by those responsible for losses or damages is

expected to prevail, however.  Other purposes are served by

filling out yellow cards and trip sheets.  These forms are

retained and used to document equipment use in lobying for

UW/IMA support.  They are also used to document the recreational

use of certain rivers that may be candidates for dams  or

increased water withdrawals.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "XI-PriorityUse">XI. Priority Use of Equipment</a></h3>



<P>

The equipment manager will organize work parties to  repair  or

construct boats and equipment. Work parties will  be  announced

in advance in club newsletters or at club meetings.  Those  who

participate in a work party have priority in the choice of  all

equipment (wet suits, spray skirts, helmets, life  vests,

paddles, and boats) for all subsequent river trips up to the

time of the next work party, when new priority is  established.

Equipment is otherwise allocated on a first-come,  first-served

basis.



<P>

<h3><A NAME = "XII-OtherRestrictions">XII. Other Restrictions on Equipment Use</a></h3>



<OL>

  <LI> The OLD TOWN HYDRO 80 RACING KAYAK (red deck, white hull,

and sharp bow point) is a fragile, fiberglass boat for

advanced paddlers who are learning slalom racing  skills.

The fiberglass DOWNRIVER (DR) KAYAKS are also racing boats.

River use of these fiberglass boats will be restricted  by  the

president to those who are interested in racing AND who have

demonstrated a willingness to help maintain these  boats.



  <LI> The OCEAN TOURING KAYAKS should be reserved in advance of any

type of planned, weekend use by filling out in advance the  ocean

touring kayak sign up sheet. (Also, it is would be wise to tape

a note on the boat).  Otherwise, this boat goes out on a

first-come, first-served basis, subject to priority earned

during a work party. Only people with RIVER  memberships  can

sign out the ocean touring kayaks for use off Lake Washington.

Further, all trips off Lake Washington require prior  approval

from either the club president or equipment  manager.  A  minimum

of three club members are required for a club  sanctioned,  ocean

touring trip. On ocean touring trips, the trip  cordinator's  name

must be on the Trip Coordinator List. Additional requirements  concerning

ocean touring are described in the 

<a href="rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>,  Section VI.



  <LI> The RAVEN 17 WHITEWATER CANOE with bow, stern, and midship

floatation bags in place can be paddled in up to Class Ill  water

such as the Big Eddy run on the Skykomish (900 to 2000 cfs)

and the Lower Gorge of the Green River (under 1500 cfs).

However, this level of difficulty is to be attempted by  only

experienced open canoeists. All Class III open  canoeing  will

receive case by case, prior approval from the president or

equipment manager.





</OL>

<P>

<h3><A NAME = "XIII-Exceptions">XIII. Exceptions</a></h3>



<P>

Exceptions to the above rules may be made by the  club  president

but only on a case by case, prior approval basis.  The  president

will be expected to seek the advice of advanced paddlers on

the safety committee when it is appropriate. One  reason  why

the responsibility inherent in this authority is placed  with

the president is the fundamental problem of anticipating river

difficulty and boater skill at some future time.  Such

foresight would be required under a more structured, less

flexible, and probably less practical set of organizational

rules requiring a skill rating for each paddler.





<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Postscript">Postscript</a></h3>



<P>

It will soon-become obvious to new members that this  club,  like

any other, faces unavoidable problems in maintaining and

controlling the use of its 'commonly owned'  property.  The  only

practical solution to this problem is to promote strong bonds  of

trust and friendship within our group. Please join  us  in  doing
