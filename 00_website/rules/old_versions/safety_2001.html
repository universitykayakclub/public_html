<h2>University Kayak Club Safety Guidelines</h2>

<p>Safety on UKC trips does not just happen. It is the result of
awareness and understanding by all members of the trip acting as
a team. We enjoy paddling because it takes us out into nature.
Whitewater and ocean kayaking, like any outdoor sport, will
always have some risk involved. Each paddler needs to consider
for themselves what level of risk they are willing to take, and
what they can do to minimize that risk. </p>

<p>What follows in Sections I to IV is a list of safety tips that
is presented to enhance our common understanding of some
necessary ingredients for safer boating. <a
href="rules/safety.html#SI">Section
I</a> contains suggestions and tips for whitewater paddling. <a
href="rules/safety.html#SII">Section
II</a> discusses ocean touring trips. These guidelines are to be
considered by one or more of the trip participants, and followed
as is deemed appropriate and necessary. <a
href="rules/safety.html#SIII">Section
III</a> describes the organization of a safety committee and a
trip coordinator rating system. <a
href="rules/safety.html#SIV">Section
IV</a> is a &quot;permitted rivers&quot; list with runs
classified, sometimes with respect to flow level. </p>

<p>A caveat is in order. These safety tips represent only a
framework for safer boating. There is more to it than is easily
described in words. The nature of the trip, the participants, and
individual circumstances will dictate the appropriateness of any
safety action taken, either as prevention of, or response to an
emergency situation. In the final analysis, safety is about
caring, and there is no rule for that. </p>

<h3><a name="SI">Section I. Whitewater Trips</a></h3>

<h4><a name="I1">Part 1: PLANNING A TRIP</h4>

<p></a><a name="I1A">A)</a> Organizing a Trip: A whitewater
paddling trip consists of at least three UKC River/Sea Members,
with at least one person who is a qualified trip coordinator. A
river trip may be organized by a group prior to the departure
date, or formed from interested paddlers who arrive at the WAC at
the appropriate time for loosely scheduled trips. As a rough
guideline, consider a 1:2 ratio, or larger, of experienced to
less experienced boaters, where 'experience' is defined relative
to the difficulty of the water to be attempted. This ratio may
change depending on the total number of boaters in the party and
their range of expertise. </p>

<p><a name="I1B">B)</a> Trip Coordinator Designation: The trip
coordinators are designated by the group and identified by being
listed on the appropriate line of the trip sheet, which must be
filled out before each river trip. The trip coordinator must be
approved by the club for the class of water involved, see <a
href="rules/safety.html#SIII">Section
III</a>. The <a
href="ww/riverboating.html#rivercoord">WW
Trip Coordinator List</a> is available in the club web site.</p>

<p><a name="I1C">C)</a> Selecting a River: The skills of the
weakest paddler and the number of weak paddlers carry the most
weight in the decision of what river to paddle. Refer to <a
href="rules/safety.html#SIV">Section
IV, Permitted River List,</a> in choosing a river. Another
consideration is the expected water level. It is good to have a
reasonable alternative river in mind given that river conditions
are always somewhat uncertain. Often, you can find out the river
level by using the world wide web or by calling the Whitewater
Hotline (526-8530). The <a
href="links/weatherl.html#riverflows">River
Flows</a> section of the club's web site has links to several
sources of flow levels. The trip coordinators have final say
about river selection. </p>

<p><a name="I1D">D)</a> River Trip Size: There may be more than
one coordinator per trip, however for organizational efficiency
on and off the river, a single lead coordinator may be
designated. A large party may also be broken up into smaller
groups each with its own set of experienced paddlers. Very large
parties (&gt; 15 ) are discouraged due to the difficulties of
organizing so many people, but the trip size is limited only by
what the trip coordinators feel is appropriate for the current
trip. </p>

<p><a name="I1E">E)</a> Trip Coordinator Authority: Each paddler
must make their own final decision on whether to run a particular
river or rapid. The trip coordinator has the authority to exclude
someone from joining a trip, or running a rapid even if the
paddler believes they are up it. The decisions of the trip
coordinators are final. </p>

<p><a name="I1F">F)</a> Trip Coordinator Responsibility: The trip
coordinator makes sure that there is adequate group safety
equipment (throw ropes, breakdown paddle, first aid kit), and
that a trip sheet is property filled out before departure. At the put-in, the trip coordinators should quickly assess the paddling
level and experience of each paddler, and arrange for pre-river
briefing as is appropriate. On the river, the trip coordinator,
or an experienced paddler designated by the coordinator, should
keep a look out for the weaker paddlers, providing skills
instruction and information on specific rapids as needed. The
trip coordinator may designate other experienced paddlers in the
group to assist with instruction, and may, when appropriate,
designate a single sweep boat. This sweep boat is generally the
last one down a rapid, and provides rescue assistance. The
coordinator works to maintain group safety by trying to assist
boaters in acting responsibly (see <a
href="rules/safety.html#I3">Part
3, Team Safety</a>). </p>

<h4><a name="I2">Part 2: Equipment</a></h4>

<p><a name="I2A">A)</a> Personal Safety Equipment: Each trip
member is responsible for making sure that they have all the
appropriate equipment, and that it is in good working order. If
you find broken gear in the clubroom, put it in the to-be-repaired bin. For a river trip, each paddler must have a
helmet<strong>, </strong>Type III life jacket, and suitable body
wear (e.g., wet suits, dry suits, warm clothing). These items are
essential. Thus, without them you may not run the river. Each
paddler is responsible to assure that these items are
appropriately marked on the trip sheet, either designated as club
or personal gear. </p>

<p><a name="I2B">B)</a> Boat Equipment: Adequate flotation, as
defined by paddler experience and type of boat, is needed in all
boats that are taken on the river. Decked boats require at least
two stem floatbags, with possibly two additional floatbags for
the bow. Open canoes require bow and stem bags, with an optional
middle bag. Check bags for leaks prior to departure from the WAC.
Each kayaker should check their boat to ensure that the foot pegs can be properly adjusted, and that there is appropriate padding
for a good fit. Each paddler is responsible for signing out his
or her equipment on the trip sheet. Identify boats by number and
briefly describe paddles and other equipment. </p>

<h4><a name="I3">Part 3: Team Safety</a></h4>

<p><a name="I3A">A)</a> Upstream Right of Way: The upstream boat
has the right of way on the river. For example, a boater playing
in a hole at the bottom of a drop should yield to upstream
boaters approaching the drop. Also, when you eddy out, be aware
of upstream boaters who may need to use that eddy. If necessary,
exit it soon enough so that they can be aware of its availability
and paddle to it. </p>

<p><a name="I3B">B)</a> Communication: Communicating on the river
may be difficult over the roar of the water and as a result of
the distance between the top and bottom of a particular rapid.
Standard paddle signals have been developed to ease
communication. Stop is indicated by a horizontal paddle raised
over the head and moved up and down. Eddy out immediately and
wait for further information. An emergency is indicated by a
waving vertical paddle. A stationary vertical paddle indicates
that it is safe to proceed. The paddle may be pointed slightly to
one side or the other indicating the recommended direction or
side of the river to be on while going down the rapid. When
giving verbal instructions, state directions or places to go, and
not what or where to avoid, unless you are certain that people
receiving the information can clearly hear the qualifiers. </p>

<p><a name="I3C">C)</a> Following: Often, a less experienced
paddler, because of unfamiliarity with a stretch of river or less-developed river reading skills, will want to follow another
boater down a rapid. The less experienced paddler must make an
explicit agreement with the more experienced paddler so that the
leading paddler is aware that someone is following. Otherwise,
the more experienced paddler might inadvertently lead the other
into a difficult situation, or to a play spot the less experienced
paddler had no intention of going. </p>

<p><a name="I3D">D)</a> Boat Spacing: Experience will teach a
paddler the appropriate spacing on the river. The spacing will
vary depending on the river flow rate, width of the river
channel, presence of eddies, and skill level of the boaters. Use
eddies to reestablish proper spacing between boats when they get
too close. Spacing that is too great makes signaling for help
difficult in an emergency. Following too close can result in
spearings or collisions when the lead boat is caught in or slowed
down by holes. When closely approaching and overtaking another
boat, be sure to give a shout, alerting the other boater to your
presence. </p>

<p><a name="I3E">E)</a> Keep Count of Upstream Boaters: Make
frequent counts of the number of boaters in your group, noting
the number of boaters upstream of you, and those that am
downstream. loosely following some order of proceeding down drops
that is either assigned or evolves, may help prevent straggling
behind or unnoticed accidents. If the trip coordinator has
designated a lead boat and a sweep boat, it is advantageous for
all paddlers to respect (to the extent that a paddler is able to
under a given situation) these positions of first and last down
the river. </p>

<p><a name="I3F">F)</a> Spearing: Watch your bow point when
entering an eddy occupied by another boater. Enter occupied
eddies under control and only if there is room. </p>

<p><a name="I3G">G)</a> Occupying an Eddy: If a second boat is
about to enter your eddy, make room or signal that there is not
enough room for another boat. Draw strokes can be helpful in
maintaining your position in an eddy. </p>

<p><a name="I3H">H)</a> &quot;Hole Etiquette:&quot; Respect the
order of boats lined up for a play hole or wave. Signal and watch
for acknowledgment when lines form on both sides of the river
above or below a play hole. If two boats unintentionally enter a
hole at the same time, practice defensive boating and yield. At
the very least, communicate loudly with the other boater (e.g.,
&quot;on your right&quot;). </p>

<p><a name="I3I">I)</a> Scouting: Scouting rapids is required
when the trip coordinator deems it necessary. Individuals may
want to do additional scouting. Notify others when you alone hold
up for scouting. </p>

<p><a name="I3J">J)</a> Swimmers: If a person swims, first go
after the boater. If the rescue of the swimmer is under control,
then chase down whatever equipment may be floating around. Do not
let the swimmer or the floating gear distract you from the fact
that you are still on a river. Remember to look downstream, and
plan your route. Do not endanger yourself or complicate the
situation by attempting a rescue in a rapid where you are not
comfortable. If you are not involved in the rescue process, then
eddy out where possible and wait for everyone to re-group. </p>

<p><a name="I3K">K)</a> Rescuing a Swimmer: (Boat Rescue) In
rescuing a swimmer, it is best to approach from the upstream side
with your stem towards the swimmer. The swimmer should be
upstream of the loose boat, holding that boat's grab loop and
paddle with one hand and reaching for the rescue boat's stem grab
loop with the other hand. The swimmer should never stick fingers
or hands through the grab loop due to the risk of breaking
fingers or entrapping the hand. Attempt to get the swimmer to the
side quickly, but take the time to look ahead and plan your
route. Find a good eddy that you can reasonably get to. Remember
that it will be a lot harder to make eddies with extra weight
dragging on the back of your boat. The swimmer should frog kick
or side stroke kick to assist the rescuer. Try to keep your
swimmer calm. Talk to the swimmer when possible, but remember
that communication is difficult in the roar of the water.
Sometimes it is best to just have them hold on and rest until you
get to the bottom of the rapid, and then paddle and swim (do not
let them forget to help you by kicking) to the side. The rescuer
may tell the swimmer to let go of the rescue boat grab loop if a
serious drop is approaching that cannot be avoided. The swimmer
must let go to avoid being speared by the rescue boat and to
allow the rescue boat to maneuver in the rapid before repeating
an attempt at rescue. The rescuer may request that the swimmer
let go of the loose boat to better assure the swimmer's swift
rescue. This may be advantageous if there are other paddlers
available to retrieve the boat. </p>

<p><a name="I3L">L)</a> Rescuing a Swimmer: (Shore Rescue) A
swimmer may be rescued from shore with the use of a throw rope.
People practiced in the techniques of using a throw rope, may be
placed at strategic locations in or below difficult rapids. These
people wait on shore with a throw rope ready in hand and watch
for swimmers needing assistance. </p>

<p><a name="I3M">M)</a> Rescuing a Pinned or Entrapped Boater: A
boat that is 'pinned' is stuck in a stationary position on the
upstream side of a log, rock, or other immobile object in the
river. The force of the water compresses the boat against the
obstruction. An entrapped boater is a person caught in the pinned
boat. This can occur when the force of the water bends the boat
downstream of the object, wrapping the boater's legs. Entrapment
may also occur when a swimmer's foot is wedged between rocks on
the river bottom, or is caught on a submerged tree branch. The
rescue of such a person can involve a complicated series of
maneuvers. The designated trip coordinator acts as the rescue
coordinator or assigns this duty to an appropriate person. The
situation should be assessed and the most appropriate action to
take determined. The type of action will be based upon the
victim's condition which should be addressed first, and the
extent of risk to the rescuers. To learn river rescue techniques,
you are encouraged to read various books and take classes on the
subject. The club has several books and videos that are available
for check out, most notably, 'River Rescue'. River safety manuals
published by the American Canoe Association are also available
for reading. The club organizes rescue practice sessions and
review of techniques. It is advised to discuss and practice
rescue techniques as often as is practical. </p>

<p><a name="I3N">N)</a> Briefing at Put In: The trip coordinator
should determine the need and extent of any briefing before
paddling the river. Paddle signals, river conditions and boat
order for proceeding down drops may be briefly reviewed at the put-in. Basic personal safety (e.g. how to safely swim and be
rescued) and basic river reading and terminology (e.g. rocks,
eddies, current) should be discussed with beginners, especially
those who have not previously been on a UKC river trip. Basic
whitewater techniques (how to avoid flipping, moving in and out
of current) may also be discussed with beginners on shore, or at
appropriate places on the river. It is the responsibility of each
paddler to ask any questions, or raise any issues about the river
conditions that might put into question a boater's ability or
comfort in paddling the proposed stretch of river. </p>

<p><a name="I3O">O)</a> Order, Eager Beavers and Stragglers: Do
not straggle behind; keep up with the group. Respect order in
passing down drops: usually, the trip coordinator first and if
designated, the &quot;sweep&quot; boat last. The sweep should
carry a breakdown paddle and a throw rope. Should the group
become spread out over a long rapid, a less experienced boater
should make an effort to stay nearby one or more boaters. </p>

<p><a name="I3P">P)</a> Wait Up for Stragglers: If you are the
second to the last boater and the last boater does lag behind
(straggler, emptying boat, cramps or anything), hold up in an
eddy and wait. Signal others downstream of you to wait up. </p>

<p><a name="I3Q">Q)</a> Buddy Support: Be supportive of learning
and intimidated boaters. </p>

<p><a name="I3R">R)</a> Speak Up About Safety: If you observe
unsafe activities or procedures, you contribute to continuing the
lack of safety by &quot;keeping it to yourself&quot;. Confront
the person acting unsafely or at least speak with the trip
coordinator. </p>

<h4><a name="I4">Part 4: Personal Safety</a></h4>

<p><a name="I4A">A)</a> Too Much, Too Fast: Boating a river, and
the individual rapids on that river, is ultimately a personal
decision, not a group decision. Ask yourself if you are willing
to cope with the water if things do not go well. If your boating
becomes primarily a constant test of guts, you are probably
biting off too much too fast. No matter how strong the group or
coordinators, you are alone in your boat. In whitewater boating,
bigger may not be better. Ask yourself who you are trying to
impress. </p>

<p><a name="I4B">B)</a> River Choice for Users of Club Equipment:
For those using club equipment, your choice of river difficulty
has implications for not only your safety but the club's survival
as well. Consequently, for users of club equipment, river choice
must be more conservative than if private equipment were used. </p>

<p><a name="I4C">C)</a> Strainers: A strainer is anything in the
river that lets water pass through, but will not let a boat pass,
for example, a partially submerged tree. The force of the river
that holds you against a strainer is incredibly strong. Strainers
are much more dangerous than rocks in the river, since the
current always flows around the rock and may push your boat with
it. Stay well away from any strainer if at all possible. Be aware
of river conditions in which strainers may be created: narrow
river channels, previous storm or flooding conditions. When
paddling with a watchful eye, strainers are often easily spotted
and avoided. If you do wash up against one, LEAN DOWNSTREAM
QUICKLY onto the obstruction or strainer. Then signal for help.
With help at hand, attempt to work yourself to clear water. Wet
escaping from your boat when pinned may be necessary but this is
a LAST resort. Popping the spray-skirt and filling the boat with
water will usually increase the possibility of entrapment in the
boat. </p>

<p><a name="I4D">D)</a> Rock and Headwall Rolls: Often found on
tight rivers, a wall is a steep section of riverbank where the
river runs head-on into it. Paddle clear of headwalls, providing
enough space to not allow the current to push the boat into it.
Flipping upstream of a headwall is to be avoided, but may happen.
Rolling up against a headwall or rock is a tough act, but rolling
up to the downstream side is the way to go. The downstream side
will be the rock side. Using your paddle may be awkward in such
cases. Climb up the rock or wall with your hands to a downstream
lean position and move yourself to safety. To repeat, the best
safety tip concerning head walls is to avoid them. Undercut
headwalls can be deathly serious, in which you may need to swim
straight down and then out, hoping to get washed out by the
current. </p>

<p><a name="I4E">E)</a> Whirlpools: Getting set up for a roll
when capsized in a whirlpool is not a simple task. Moving the
paddle around under water becomes very difficult. The downstream
edge of your boat is constantly changing and is found more by
chance than anything else. Observation of whirlpools will show,
though, that they dissipate and periodically reform. Thus, the
best strategy is often to wait, hoping to get washed out or to
roll during a momentary canning of the water. </p>

<p><a name="I4F">F)</a> Variable River Difficulty. Flow levels
and water and air temperatures affect the difficulty of a
particular run. A particular rapid at a low flow rate can
increase in difficulty by one or more class level ratings at
higher water levels, when the water may be more 'pushy' and the
consequences of a paddling mistake may be quite serious. Colder
temperatures can increase paddler fatigue and exhaustion,
especially in the case of a swim. </p>

<p><a name="I4G">G)</a> Swimming: In a swim, keep your FEET UP
high near the surface of the water, AND DOWNSTREAM. Never walk on
the bottom, crawl out of the river when you are in slow flowing,
shallow water near the bank. The danger in moving water is
pinning a foot between rocks and getting knocked over by the
current. You may have the strength to hold yourself out of the
water for a few moments, however, your body will relax with your
head under water in the &quot;resting&quot; position. When
swimming, try to hold onto all of your equipment, but if your
safety is in question, then let go of it. Stay upstream of your
boat if possible. Always be looking ahead to avoid possible
entrapment situations. You can often use a backstroke or
sidestroke to swim to an eddy or to shore. At times, you may want
to wait until the end of the rapid before trying to get to shore.
In that case, the best strategy may be to conserve your body heat
and strength by simply wrapping your arms around your chest and
floating down stream keeping yourself as relaxed as possible. Let
your fellow paddlers come to you. If you are passing through
rough water, relax and concentrate on the timing of a good breath
of air when one becomes available. </p>

<p>While swimming in rough water, you may find yourself
approaching a hole or reversal. Letting go of your boat when
trapped in a large reversal may be necessary, although often you
will wash through holes created by reversals. Generally, letting
go of your paddle when you are stuck in a reversal is not a good
idea. This is a controversial subject. However, letting go of
your paddle when in a strong reversal leaves you helpless like a
cork. The only option then may be to swim toward the bottom of
the hole in an attempt to catch a downstream flowing jet of
water. Keeping your paddle may help you catch such a jet more
easily or may help you in working out the side of the hole. </p>

<p>When a paddler approaches you for a rescue, listen to their
instructions. Grab the stem (back loop on the rescue boat as soon
as possible, and always without putting either your fingers or
hand through the loop. The goal is to get you out of the water as
quickly as possible without compromising either your or the
rescuer's safety. Assist the rescuer by kicking, and by letting
go of either your boat or theirs when told to do so. A swimmer
may also be rescued with the use of a throw rope. If a rope is
tossed to you, grab the bag, knot or whatever is on the rope-end
as quickly as possible. Hold the rope with it on your chest, so
that you are floating on your back with your feet up. This is the
safest position to be pulled over the water, because an air
pocket is created by the head. Should the rope become caught, and
your safety placed in danger, let it go immediately. </p>

<p><a name="I4H">H)</a> Paddling in Holes: Many holes and small
reversals can be 'punched' by paddling very strongly and swiftly
through it. However, all boaters find themselves caught in a hole
at sometime or another. Lean downstream and onto a brace. The
pillow of water formed by the reversal hydraulic will support a
pretty heavy brace or roll sweep stoke. In most situations
staying in your boat when you flip over in a hole is a good
choice as rolling up onto a downstream brace on the reversal wave
is not as difficult as it may appear to be. Rolling up onto the
upstream side of the hole is difficult and unstable. If the
downstream side is your offside and you do not yet have the
offside roll, try putting the paddle out at right angles to the,
boat to the downstream side. The surface current may catch your
paddle and roll you up. The undercurrent may also catch the body
of an overturned paddler and push both paddler and boat out of
the hole to calmer water where rolling on either side would be
effective. </p>

<p>There is the choice of bracing or rolling when you are tipped
in a hole, and it is worthwhile to realize that awkward and
shoulder-damaging braces occur very easily. Do not extend your
arm back behind the plane of your body or over your head. Rather
than struggle with an overextended brace, drop into the roll
position and see how easily you will roll up. Once upright with a
delicately balanced downstream lean (not usually an extreme
downstream lean) the next step is to work your boat toward one
end of the hole where it will push either your stem or bow out.
This is accomplished with sculling strokes. </p>

<p>Advanced boaters may purposefully drop into a hole for
practice or for play. Note that in riding a hole, very little
bracing may be required. The key is to move your boat with subtle
hip action feeling yourself actually sitting on (or slightly
upstream of) the whitewater crest of the surfing wave, weight
slightly shifted in a downstream lean, with the trunk of your
body as upright and vertical as comfortable. Quick moves to cut
back laterally across the face of the wave are made most easily
by first riding up on the wave crest so that it is right beneath
your buttocks and the bow and stem points are clear (or nearly
clear) of the water. </p>

<p><a name="I4I">I)</a> First Aid and CPR: Learn or refresh your
understanding of first aid and CPR. The University and the Red
Cross have regularly scheduled classes, and in the past the club
has sponsored classes as well. Club trip coordinators are
encouraged to have current basic first aid and CPR certification.
</p>

<p><a name="I4J">J)</a> Physical Fitness: Generally good physical
conditioning supplemented with some weight work can prevent many
injuries, particularly shoulder injuries. Consult books and
articles (some relevant articles are kept in the club 'library')
which discuss appropriate muscle development and exercise. Lake
paddling is a good tune-up for a river trip if you have been away
from the sport a while, and an opportunity to develop proper
paddling technique. The way you paddle can go a long way towards
reducing the danger of shoulder dislocation. Avoid any motion
that puts your arm up and to the back relative to the trunk of
the body. Keep your elbows low. In particular, learn to use the
low brace (using the backside of the paddle kept below shoulder
level) as much as possible. </p>

<p><a name="II1"><strong>Part 1: Discussion and Classification</strong></a></p>

<p><a name="II1A">A)</a>  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Skills
and Equipment: The skills and equipment required for safe ocean touring have
considerable overlap with those required for whitewater boating, but there are
some important differences. The following discussion, though not exhaustive,
gives some examples of these differences.</span> </p>

<ol>
    <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Equipment:
      Sea kayaks are designed for efficient travel in a straight line, not for
      ease of turning. They are also designed with load carrying ability in
      mind. To accommodate the higher speed at which a sea kayak is generally
      paddled, the sea kayak paddle is longer than a whitewater paddle. Sea
      kayakers need to dress for cold water immersion, but this must often be
      balanced with the likelihood of a capsize and the expected air
      temperatures, since overheating can be a problem in the warm months. When
      in doubt, the sea kayaker should dress for cold water immersion, since it
      can be very difficult to put on clothing if the conditions get difficult.
      Sea kayakers need some means of stabilizing their boat for reentry after a
      capsize and wet exit. This is one of the most important differences from
      whitewater kayaking, since whitewater kayakers almost never need to
      reenter their boats in the water after a wet exit.</span> </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Skills:
      Since sea kayakers may find themselves far from shore, it is extremely
      important that the sea kayaker know how to recover from a capsize and wet
      exit. On a river, rescue from shore is often a possibility, and it is
      often the case that the capsized paddler washes out of the difficult spot
      into easier conditions. On the ocean, the conditions which caused a
      capsize will often be there after the capsize, and may not lessen for
      hours or even days. River kayakers often paddle in conditions which test
      their limits, with the result that they often practice their roll in
      realistic conditions. Sea kayakers may only rarely encounter conditions
      which test their limits, with the result that their roll is seldom
      practiced in realistic conditions. The result is that many sea kayakers do
      not have reliable rolling skills. When they do encounter conditions which
      test their limits, the situation is generally quite dangerous, since the
      consequences of a capsize in conditions near the limits of a paddler's
      ability may be severe. For this reason, although proficiency in the Eskimo
      roll is strongly encouraged, it is not sufficient. Sea kayakers need to
      know how to recover unassisted from a capsize and wet exit, without going
      ashore. They also need to be familiar with techniques for assisting
      another kayakers to reenter their boat after a wet exit.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="II1B">B)</a>  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Classification
of Sea Kayak Trips: Classification of ocean trips is somewhat different than
classification of river trips. For example, the expected difficulty of a river
is usually well defined if the flow rate is known. On the ocean, this is not
usually the case, since conditions on the ocean are very strongly influenced by
the weather conditions encountered. The same stretch of water can be flat calm
and glassy smooth one day and a maelstrom the next. In fact, the change can
occur within minutes or even seconds. For this reason it is difficult to rate
ocean trips in the same way that river trips are rated. The ratings given to an
ocean trip must consider the potential for hazardous conditions, and the
difficulty of escaping from them if they occur. The UKC will use the following
rating system:</span></p>

rating system gives a good idea of the skill level needed for a kayaker to go on
a trip without more experienced companions. The presence of more experienced
companions with good judgment can allow a relatively inexperienced paddler to
participate safely in a trip, even though the rating system might indicate that
the trip is too difficult. A general guideline might be that inexperienced
paddlers should be paired with experienced paddlers on trips in the moderate to
exposed categories. Such considerations are the responsibility of the trip
coordinator, and depending on anticipated weather or other conditions, the trip
coordinator may decide that a person's experience is inadequate for a planned
trip. The trip coordinator may also decide that the anticipated conditions allow
a relatively inexperienced paddler to undertake a more advanced trip. In making
this judgment, the trip coordinator should take into consideration the expected
weather, time of year (off season should indicate greater caution), overall
strength of the party, and other factors such as the physical condition and
stamina of the paddler.</span></p>

<p><a name="II4"><strong>Part 4: Group and Individual Safety</strong></a></p>

<p><a name="II4A">A)</a> General Ocean Touring Safety: </p>

<p>Safe ocean touring requires several different types of skills.
Randel Washburne, in his book &quot;The Coastal Kayaker's
Manual&quot; describes four concentric rings of defense. </p>

<ol>
    <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The
      outermost ring involves avoiding trouble in the first place, by learning
      about the way tide currents, weather conditions and other factors affect
      paddling conditions. Also included in this ring of defense would be
      learning how to see dangerous conditions in time to avoid them. A tide
      rip, if seen in time can often be avoided by paddling in the correct
      direction. Pre-trip planning will indicate the best times to traverse
      areas with particularly strong tide currents. A study of the local weather
      patterns can allow the anticipation of strong afternoon winds in areas
      where heating of the land produces them. Since this outermost ring allows
      the paddler to avoid trouble in the first place, it should not be
      neglected in favor of the inner three.</span> </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">If
      the outermost ring fails (or you like to paddle in rough conditions), the
      next ring involves capsize avoidance in rough conditions. The important
      skills in this ring of defense are the boat handling skills common to all
      kayaking: bracing, handling waves, wind etc. These skills should be
      practiced by all kayakers. Whitewater boaters routinely paddle in
      conditions which require them to practice capsize avoidance skills. Since
      sea kayakers often do not, they should form a habit of practicing bracing
      skills whenever they paddle. A solid reflexive brace is one of the best
      capsize prevention skills a sea kayaker can posses. Even better is to
      practice in rough conditions in a safe location so that the reflexive
      bracing skills are tested by real conditions.</span> </li>
    <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The next ring of
      defense involves recovery from a capsize. By far the best method for this
      is the Eskimo roll. No other capsize recovery method is as rapid. It is
      important to realize that them may be conditions under which an Eskimo
      roll fails. In such circumstances, it is imperative to be able to perform
      some other method of capsize recovery. A point worth stressing is that the
      paddler will be much more likely to succeed in reentering a kayak if
      dressed for immersion in the anticipated water temperatures. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span> </li>
    <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The final ring of
      defense involves signaling for help. Needless to say, if a situation gets
      to this point, the paddler is in extreme danger. Methods for attracting
      potential rescuers involve signaling devices, such as flares and marine
      VHF radios. Depending on the location, and difficulty of the trip, any or
      all of these methods might be used. As an absolute minimum, a kayaker
      should carry flares on any trip. Without such aids it can be extremely
      difficult or impossible to attract attention since a kayak is small and
      not easily seen, especially in the conditions under which an accident is
      most likely to occur. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="II4B">B)</a> Group Management Guidelines:</p>

<p>A number of procedures should be agreed on for travel in a
group. The trip coordinator should discuss these with all trip
participants. </p>

<ol>
    <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The group should
      stay together. If paddlers are of widely different strength, the slower
      paddlers should not be left behind to fend for themselves. Depending on
      conditions, a fast and slow group might be allowable, but
      there must be a clear understanding of the route and planned meeting place
      by all involved. In adverse conditions, it is important that the whole
      group stay within voice communication distance. It can be extremely
      difficult to regroup if a party is separated without a clear meeting place
      arranged. In a large group, pairing experienced with inexperienced
      paddlers will help to keep the group together, and provide the less
      experienced with assistance if difficult conditions arise. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The day's plans
      should be discussed before departure. The trip coordinator should take
      advantage of this to help less experienced participants learn about
      pre-trip planning. Contingency plans should be discussed, so that a
      minimum of discussion is necessary if the contingency plan is needed. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span> </li>
    <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">A set of signals
      should be understood by all members of the party. Visual signals are those
      of the American Whitewater Association: STOP is indicated by holding the
      paddle horizontally over the head, and moving it up and down. HELP or
      EMERGENCY is signaled by holding the paddle vertically and waving it from
      side to side. COME AHEAD is indicated by holding the paddle vertically,
      without waving it. If a particular course is to be indicated, the paddle
      should lean toward the desired course (this might be used in directing
      someone through surf, for example). <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span> </li>
    <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">All group
      decisions need to be made with the experience and ability of the weakest
      member of the party in mind. Experienced paddlers should remember that
      conditions which seem easy to them may well cause an inexperienced paddler
      to capsize. All kayakers would do well to remember that a capsize
      situation is much more serious in the ocean than it usually is on a river
      or lake. On the ocean, the option of taking the swimmer ashore is rarely
      feasible. <o:p>
      </o:p>

proposed route, people involved, etc., the suggestions should be sent only to
the trip leader and not to the entire trip review committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If a member of the trip review committee has a problem regarding the
proposed trip, that member should email these concerns to the coordinator and
the rest of the trip review committee for discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If these concerns are considered substantial by a majority of other
committee members who have taken the time to review the proposed trip in some
detail, then modifications of the trip may be required, i.e. re-routing,
shortening, adding experienced people, etc... This would ultimately be decided
upon by the sea safety committee. (NOTE: There is never a desire to
prevent a proposed trip from happening, only that it proceeds as safely as
possible without too much restriction. communication amongst all of us will be
the key!) <o:p>

<h3><a name="SIII">Section III. Safety Committee and Trip
Coordinator List</a></h3>

<h4><a name="III1">Safety Committee</a></h4>

<p>The club has a safety committee composed of at least seven
members as follows: four of the club officers (president,
vice-president, treasurer and equipment manager) and no less than
three expert paddlers. </p>

<p>The functions of the safety committee are (this is taken from
the club constitution): </p>

<ol>
    <li>To make decisions concerning the classification of the
        difficulty of various river runs not currently listed on
        the &quot;permitted rivers list&quot; that are to be
        added (see <a
        href="rules/safety.html#SIV">Section
        IV</a>, below); </li>
    <li>To make additions or deletions of names to the Class I,
        II, III, and IV <a
        href="ww/riverboating.html#rivercoord">River</a>
        and <a
        href="sea/UKCSea.html#seacoord">Sea</a>
        Trip Coordinator Lists at least each autumn quarter,
        preferably each quarter; </li>
    <li>To determine penalties for members violating club rules
        and safety procedures; </li>
    <li>To suggest to the club executive board various safety
        education activities that should be undertaken; </li>
    <li>To periodically edit and update the document, &quot;<a
        href="rules/safety.html">Safety
        Guidelines</a>&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="III2">Ocean Touring Trip Coordinator Requirements</a></h4>

<p>For a trip coordinator at the exposed level: </p>

<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Whitewater boating skill at the Class III level or
        greater is suggested, or equivalent boat handling skills
        in a sea kayak. Knowledge of reading whitewater is not a
        necessary skill for sea kayakers, but the boat handling
        skills required to paddle class III whitewater are a good
        indication of the general level of proficiency expected
        of an ocean touring trip coordinator. </li>
    <li>A proficient, &quot;combat&quot; (as opposed to pool)
        roll is suggested. An alternate backup reentry method is
        required. A trip coordinator must be able to reenter a
        boat after a wet exit without assistance using the paddle
        float outrigger method or something similar. </li>
    <li>Chart reading experience and knowledge of tides and tide
        currents is mandatory. (The club will hold a training
        session to introduce club members to these and other
        aspects of ocean touring seamanship.) </li>
    <li>Knowledge of marine weather conditions and their effects
        on paddling are essential. The trip coordinator must be
        able to obtain marine forecasts, and know how to
        interpret them. An ability to interpret weather signs in
        the absence of a forecast is also desirable. Since this
        is a subjective area, it is difficult to establish an
        objective test of this ability. What is expected is
        familiarity with the signs of imminent bad weather and
        knowledge of appropriate tactics when faced with bad
        weather. </li>
    <li>Good judgment is mandatory. In choosing names for the <a
        href="sea/UKCSea.html#seacoord">Sea
        Kayaking Trip Coordinator List</a>, the Safety Committee
        will rank this criterion above all others. </li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="III3">Whitewater Trip Coordinator Requirements</a></h4>

<p>For whitewater trips, we have a posted list of approved trip
coordinators. The coordinators are explicitly ranked by the
difficulty, or class, of river for a designated trip. The
coordinators are chosen considering a variety of leadership
qualities and paddling skills. A qualified coordinator has a
balance of these abilities. At least one member of the Safety
Committee will have paddled with the candidate several times in
order to make an informed decision on the capabilities of the
candidate. </p>

<p>It is expected that the person be comfortable paddling at the
level above the class of whitewater on which they would be
coordinating trips. Important whitewater skills are boat
handling, rescue techniques, water reading and river scouting. A
coordinator needs to be a responsible person who will make good
decisions concerning the safety of a trip. The coordinator should
be sensitive to the abilities and comfort levels of
less-experienced paddlers. A trip coordinator who is also a good
paddling instructor is beneficial to the club. </p>

<p>A current version of the <a
href="ww/riverboating.html#rivercoord">WW
Trip Coordinator List</a> is in the club's web site.</p>

<h3><a name="SIV">Section IV. Permitted Rivers List</a></h3>
