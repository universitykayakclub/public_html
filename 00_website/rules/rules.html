<h2>Overview</h2>



The task of writing down rules is unpleasant; the pressure to

enforce rules becomes greater, and kayakers as a group appear

to make poor recruiting material for a police force.

Nevertheless, as the number of club members increases with many

complete novices joining, the need for explicit rules and

safety instruction grows. 



<P>

The organizational structure, rules, and operating procedures of the University

Kayak Club are described in the <a

href="rules/constitution.html">Club

Constitution</a> and two bylaw documents, <a

href="rules/bylaws.html">Rules and

Customs</a>, and <a

href="rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>. All three documents are included in the Club Officer Edition of

the Guide Book and are posted on the club bulletin board at the WAC boathouse.

Just the bylaws are included in the Membership Edition of the Guide Book.



<P>

Drafts of all three documents were written in the spring and

summer of 1985 by George Sheldon. Final 1986 versions

reflected suggestions made by personnel at the Student

Activities office, John and Ellen Hokanson, Clive Lister, Mark

Redland, Mollie Bigger, Tommy Swearingen, Ed Mulligan, Kirk

Weller, Brad Bell, Dan Dailey, and many other club members.

Steve Fox had important suggestions concerning ocean touring

that were incorporated into the 1987 <em>Safety Guidelines</em>.

All three of these documents change as new club members

arrive on the scene with new experience and viewpoints.  



<P>

These documents provide a good starting point for

subsequent revisions, as does the following advice:

(1) for a rule to be a good rule, it must

necessarily be practically enforceable; (2) precedent

concerning which rules are enforced and how over-rides all

written rules; (3) rules that continually vary constrain no

one; and, (4) most important, trust growing from friendships is

really what makes or breaks any club like the University Kayak

Club.



<P>

Thanks to all those who have helped in the preparation of the

Constitution, Bylaws, and Safety Guidelines.
