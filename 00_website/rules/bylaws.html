Club ID cards are color coded to indicate the type of

membership.&nbsp; ID cards are to be given to office personnel at

the Waterfront Activities Center (WAC) exchange for the

club boathouse key and returned when the key is returned.&nbsp; ID cards will be

provided to new members only after they have successfully performed a swim test,
completed their forms, and paid their dues.<P>

&nbsp;<P>

Membership forms may be completed, the swim test taken, and dues may be paid at
any club pool session during autumn, winter, or spring quarters.&nbsp; Pool
sessions are held on most weekends in a quarter.&nbsp; During summer quarter,
the club conducts, according to demand, lake sessions which fill the same
role.&nbsp; The dates of both pool and lake sessions are announced on the club's
website.&nbsp;

The officers of the club are the president, vice-president,

treasurer, secretary, and equipment manager. (See the

<a href="../rules/constitution.html">Club

Constitution</a>



for information on members who serve as club representatives to the Student Activities Office).



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

Club officers are elected at a meeting held at the end of each

spring quarter. The term of office for all officers and

committee chairpersons will be from the spring quarter election

meeting of one year to the spring quarter election meeting of

the following year. Any vacancies in the officer and committee

chairmanship positions that arise will be filled to serve the

remainder of-the term by vote of the executive board.&nbsp; The club executive committee may appoint members to serve as beginner trip
planner, environmental affairs chairperson, safety instructor, canoe
chairperson, racing committee chairperson, and other ad hoc positions.



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

Each fall, the safety committee will draw up a list of ocean

touring trip coordinators and whitewater trip coordinators for Class II,

III, and IV water, review the 

<a href="../rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>, and update the Safety Guidelines as necessary.&nbsp; Also at this time, the
safety committee will designate individuals who will receive

instructor status memberships.

&nbsp;

<h2><A NAME = "IV-Meetings">IV. Club Meetings</a></h2>



<P>Unless other arrangements are announced, club meetings will be held the
evening of the second Thursday of each quarter in the upstairs meeting rooms of
the Waterfront Activities Center (WAC).&nbsp; The final club meeting of the academic year is the election

meeting held during the last two weeks of the spring quarter.&nbsp; All club
meetings will be announced via email or posted on the club web site.

<h2><A NAME = "V-PoolSessions">V. Pool Sessions and Beginner Trips</a></h2>



<P>

Pool sessions will be held at the Hec Edmundson Pavilion pool

each Sunday morning 9:00 am to 11:00 am during the fall through

spring quarters. Pool sessions will not usually be scheduled

during holidays, near finals, and breaks between quarters. Typically,

there are a couple Sundays each year when use of the Husky Stadium preempts UKC
access to the pool.



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

Only UKC members or people joining the club may attend pool sessions, and those doing so are

expected to arrive at the WAC boathouse at 8:30 am on Sunday to

help transport boats to the pool.



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

Boats have to be rinsed out thoroughly, with any float bags removed,

outside the pool building before bringing the boats inside to

the pool. Care must be taken in moving boats into and out of

the pool building to avoid damaging benches and tiles. When

paddling in the pool, avoid sharp blows with your bow or stern

and the sides of the pool.&nbsp; At one time tennis ball halves were taped

to the bow and stern points of boats.&nbsp; Because the damaged

tennis balls would often fill up with dirt that was difficult

to rinse out, however, this practice was discontinued.



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

The club vice-president is responsible for organizing pool

sessions.



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

Beginner trips often follow Sunday morning pool sessions. By

custom, beginner trip coordinators do not pay transportation costs to

and from the river.

<h2><A NAME = "VI-NewMember">VI. New Member Kayak Wet Exit and Tow</a></h2>



<P>

All new members are required to demonstrate a kayak wet exit and tow

prior to use of club equipment on any body of water.&nbsp; This test is known as
a swim test, as a wet exit following a capsize is called a swim in kayaker
parlance.&nbsp; Swim tests are conducted at pool and lake sessions.&nbsp; Other arrangements can be made by

contacting the club vice-president.

<P>

&nbsp;

<h2><A NAME = "VII-ThreePersonRule">VII. Three Members Per Trip</a></h2>



<P>

At least three club members must paddle together on any club river or flat water
trip.&nbsp; One of these club members must be a trip coordinator.&nbsp; The three member rule does not apply to

paddling on the lake.



<P>

&nbsp;



<P>

In general, club equipment can only be used for the purpose of engaging in club
activities.&nbsp; The principal exception to this rule is when someone is

participating in a slalom race, slalom race practice, or

whitewater rodeo where other paddlers will be present.&nbsp; Such

exceptions are made on a case by case, prior approval basis by the

club president and should be made in a written form, such as email.

Class Of Whitewater and Duration of Trip

</a></h2>



<P>

Club whitewater trips, and thus the use of club boats and other  equipment,

are restricted to rivers listed as permitted under Section

VII of the document titled 

<a href="../rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>. The  water flow

limits specified in the permitted rivers list further

constrain the choice of rivers for a club trip.&nbsp; Note  that  club

equipment use on Class IV water is limited to a few runs and

Class V use is not permitted.&nbsp; See the

<a href="../rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a> for

other rules concerning trip coordinators responsibilities and  required

safety procedures and safety  equipment.<P>

Boat use is permitted on multiday  club  trips  of  more  than  three

days and to rivers which are not named in  the permitted rivers list only with the approval  of  the  club  president  or  equipment

manager.&nbsp; Such decisions will be made  on  a  case-by-case,  prior

approval basis and should be made in a written form, such as email.

<h2><A NAME = "IX-Safety">IX. Safety</a></h2>



<P>

Details concerning safety are described in the 

<a href="../rules/safety.html">Safety

Guidelines</a>.  Key safety rules include:



<OL>

  <LI> Every trip must be conducted by a designated trip coordinator who

     has previously run the river and is approved for the class

     of water expected.&nbsp; See the Trip Coordinator List described in the

     <a href="../rules/safety.html">Safety

	 Guidelines</a>.&nbsp; The trip coordinator and other trip members

     must be listed on the trip sheet filed in a notebook in

     the boathouse (see <a href = "#X-EquipmentSignOut">Section X</a>, below).



  <LI> A break-down paddle, two throw ropes, and a first aid

     kit should be brought on every river trip.&nbsp; A special trip

     pack is required for ocean touring, and this is described in

     Section VI of the 

     <a href="../rules/safety.html">Safety

	 Guidelines</a>.&nbsp; Every club member

     on a trip must have a helmet, life jacket, and spray

     skirt.&nbsp; A wet suit or dry suit is usually required,

     although this may not be necessary in the summer.



  <LI> If a trip coordinator deems a person's equipment

     insufficient or unsafe, or a person's paddling skills

     inadequate for a particular run, the trip coordinator may

     refuse to allow that person to  participate  or  continue  on

     a river trip.  The trip coordinator's decision is final.



  <LI> Checking the river level (cubic  feet  per  second  flpw

     rate) is a must before each whitewater trip.

<P>

&nbsp;

<h2><A NAME = "X-EquipmentSignOut">X. Signing Out Equipment</a></h2>



<P>

Club equipment used on the lake must  be  signed  out  by

completely filling out a yellow card  listing  all  equipment,  by

number where possible.<P>

Yellow cards for lake paddling are located and

filed on the desk in the clubroom.&nbsp; For river trips and all other

paddling, yellow cards needn't be filled out but trip sheets,

must be.&nbsp; Trip sheets contain the same information as the

yellow cards and are filed in a notebook in the clubroom.<P>

&nbsp;<P>

Both yellow cards and trip sheets contain statements obligating

users to compensate the club for the replacement and repair  of

lost or damaged equipment, or to perform acceptable repairs

themselves.&nbsp; The equipment manager will be the judge of what

repair work is acceptable to the degree that compensation isn't

required.&nbsp; Members may appeal the decision of the equipment

manager to the executive committee.&nbsp; The executive committee will

determine the amount of compensation if necessary.<P>

&nbsp;<P>

Yellow cards and trip sheets will be used to determine  who  is

responsible for lost or damaged equipment.&nbsp; An honor  system  of

self-reporting by those responsible for losses or damages is

expected to prevail, however.&nbsp; Other purposes are served by

filling out yellow cards and trip sheets.&nbsp; These forms are

retained and used to document equipment use and for lobbying for UW/IMA support
of the club.&nbsp; They are also used to document the recreational

use of certain rivers that may be candidates for dams  or

increased water withdrawals and provide a component of the club's legal
protection.

<h2><A NAME = "XI-PriorityUse">XI. Priority Use of Equipment</a></h2>



<P>

The equipment manager will organize work parties to  repair  or

construct boats and equipment. Work parties will  be  announced

in advance via email or the club website.&nbsp; Those  who

participate in a work party have priority in the choice of  all

equipment (wet suits, spray skirts, helmets, life  vests,

paddles, and boats) for all subsequent trips up to the

time of the next work party, when new priority is  established.&nbsp; Equipment is otherwise allocated on a first-come,  first-served

basis.

<h2><A NAME = "XII-OtherRestrictions">XII. Other Restrictions on Equipment Use</a></h2>



<OL>

  <LI> The Seda Impulse sea kayak is fiberglass boat for advanced
    paddlers.&nbsp; It should be treated with care as it does not have a bow
    bulkhead and is not as durable as the plastic sea kayaks.&nbsp; When the
    Impulse is paddled without the use of a sea sock, the Impulse's special bow
    float bag must be in place, inflated to fill most (but not quite all) of the
    bow volume, and secured in place with its special lanyard.&nbsp; Like all
    float bags, the volume of air in the Impulse's bow bag will expand and
    contract as the temperature changes.&nbsp; Because of the bag's size and
    close fit to the Impulse, there is risk thermal expansion could cause high
    pressure to develop in the bag, possibly exploding either the bag or the
    Impulse's bow.&nbsp; Leaving the bag slightly less than full protects
    against this hazard, and the bag should be deflated slightly if it is found
    to be pressurized.&nbsp; If use of the bow float bag is made impractical by
    the stowage of overnight equipment in the Impulse or other reasons,
    equivalent floatation must be present in the bow and a sea sock must be used
    to prevent possible loss of floatation due to flooding of the bow in the
    event of a capsize or leak.&nbsp; Wet exiting and reentering a sea kayak
    fitted with a sea sock is somewhat different from doing the same with a
    kayak without a sock.&nbsp; Thus, paddlers needing to use the Impulse in a
    configuration with the sock are required to practice, beforehand, at least
    sea kayak self rescue techniques with the sock in place.

  <LI> 

The fiberglass downriver (DR) kayak is a fragile, fiberglass boat for

advanced paddlers who are learning racing skills.

River use of these fiberglass boats will be restricted  by  the

president to those who are interested in racing AND who have

demonstrated a willingness to help maintain these  boats.



  <LI> The Raven 17 whitewater canoe with bow, stern, and midship

floatation bags in place can be paddled in up to Class II  water

such as the Big Eddy run on the Skykomish (900 to 2000 cfs)

and the Lower Gorge of the Green River (under 1500 cfs).

However, this level of difficulty is to be attempted by  only

experienced open canoeists.&nbsp; All Class III open  canoeing  will

receive case by case, prior approval from the president or

equipment manager.

<h2><A NAME = "XIII-Exceptions">XIII. Exceptions</a></h2>



<P>

Exceptions to the above rules may be made by the  club  president

but only on a case by case, prior approval basis.&nbsp; Such exceptions should
be made in writing.&nbsp; The  president

will be expected to seek the advice of advanced paddlers on

the safety committee when it is appropriate.

It will soon become obvious to new members that this  club,  like

any other, faces unavoidable problems in maintaining and

controlling the use of its commonly owned  property.&nbsp; The  only
