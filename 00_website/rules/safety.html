		<h2>University Kayak Club Safety Guidelines</h2>
		<p>Safety on UKC trips does not just happen. It is the result of awareness and understanding by all members of the trip acting as a team. We enjoy paddling because it takes us out into nature. Whitewater and ocean kayaking, like any outdoor sport, will always have some risk involved. Each paddler needs to consider for themselves what level of risk they are willing to take, and what they can do to minimize that risk.</p>
		<p>What follows in Sections I to IV is a list of safety tips that is presented to enhance our common understanding of some necessary ingredients for safer boating. <a href="#lake">Section I</a> describes guidelines for paddling on Lake Washington,&nbsp; <a href="#ww_trips">Section II</a> contains suggestions and tips for whitewater paddling.&nbsp; <a href="#sea">Section III</a> discusses ocean touring trips. These guidelines are to be considered by one or more of the trip participants, and followed as is deemed appropriate and necessary.&nbsp; <a href="#safety_committee">Section IV</a> describes the organization of a safety committee and a trip coordinator rating system.</p>
		<h2><a name="lake"></a>Section I. Lake Washington Rules</h2>
		<p>The University has a fleet of kayaks available for club member use on Lake Washington and many of you have joined the club to take advantage of this great resource. In making these boats available, everyone has a responsibility to observe some basic but important safety precautions. Please remember that you must be a club member to use our boats (friends on campus can join the club, folks from off campus can rent a boat from one of the local outfitters including WAC rentals which has canoes).</p>
		<p>First, make sure you fill out a Yellow Card. This is important to document use of club gear and is important for making decisions regarding gear purchase and university funding. As you leave the WAC and get ready to launch your boat, make sure you are wearing a life jacket.</p>
		<p>When on the lake, we recommend that you paddle with a buddy. Other outfitters on the lake (NWOC, Agua Verde) do make kayaks available for individual paddlers and our boats are also available in this manner but paddling with a buddy provides an additional measure of safety.</p>
		<p>Boats should only be used on the lake when the WAC is open. If you are paddling during hours that the WAC is not open then you must follow the guidelines for a club trip (a minimum of three boats and an approved trip coordinator).</p>
		<p>Before venturing out on the lake it's best to spend time in the pool to work on your roll. A confident roll is your best safety tool and our pool sessions are available to provide you with an opportunity to learn this important safety skill. In addition, take a rescue skills clinic (these are typically informally organized by sending an email to the sea kayak trip coordinator list).</p>
		<p>Make sure that you have float bags. Some of our boats will sink without flotation. An inflated float bag is an essential piece of safety gear. They are typically removed from boats during storage, but must be used when paddling on the lake.</p>
		<p>We allow you to take boats throughout Lake Washington, but use careful judgement when venturing out beyond the WAC. One of the greatest dangers on Lake Washington, particularly during the winter months, is hypothermia. If you are just learning, stay within the relatively protected waters of the Arboretum or paddle along the shore. This is also the best way to avoid large boat traffic. Travel through the Montlake Cut is not advised unless you have a strong set of skills. Waves from boats can create a significant hazard in the cut. Wet suits are available for your use during the winter months and provide an additional layer of safety.</p>
		<p>Finally, we have three boats that require a more advanced skill set. These are our three fiberglass boats that include the Impulse (a sea kayak), the double sea kayak, and the downriver race boat. If you have not received training in these craft please do not use them. If you have any questions regarding use of our more specialized boats please do not hesitate to contact the appropriate interest group tzar.<br>

		<h2><a name="ww_trips"></a>Section II. Whitewater</h2>
		<h4><a name="ww_plan_trip"></a>Part 1: PLANNING A TRIP</h4>
		<p>A) Organizing a Trip: A whitewater paddling trip consists of at least three UKC River/Sea Members, with at least one person who is a qualified trip coordinator. A river trip may be organized by a group prior to the departure date, or formed from interested paddlers who arrive at the WAC at the appropriate time for loosely scheduled trips. As a rough guideline, consider a 1:2 ratio, or larger, of experienced to less experienced boaters, where experience is defined relative to the difficulty of the water to be attempted. This ratio may change depending on the total number of boaters in the party and their range of expertise.</p>
		<p>B) Trip Coordinator Designation: The trip coordinators are designated by the group and identified by being listed on the appropriate line of the trip sheet, which must be filled out before each river trip. The trip coordinator must be approved by the club for the class of water involved, see <a href="#safety_committee">Section III</a>. The <a href="http://students.washington.edu/%7eukc/ww/overview/coordinators.html">WW Trip Coordinator List</a> is available in the club web site.</p>
		<p>C) Selecting a River: The skills of the weakest paddler and the number of weak paddlers carry the most weight in the decision of what river to paddle. Refer to the <a href="../ww/overview/rivers.html">Permitted River List</a>, in choosing a river. Another consideration is the expected water level. It is good to have a reasonable alternative river in mind given that river conditions are always somewhat uncertain. Often, you can find out the river level by using the world wide web or by calling the Whitewater Hotline (526-8530). The <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/state/WA/">American Whitewater StreamKeeper</a> project has extensive information on flow levels. The trip coordinators have final say about river selection.</p>
		<p>D) River Trip Size: There may be more than one coordinator per trip, however for organizational efficiency on and off the river, a single lead coordinator may be designated. A large party may also be broken up into smaller groups each with its own set of experienced paddlers. Very large parties of 15 paddlers or more are discouraged due to the difficulties of organizing so many people, but the trip size is limited only by what the trip coordinators feel is appropriate for the current trip.</p>
		<p>E) Trip Coordinator Authority: Each paddler must make their own final decision on whether to run a particular river or rapid. The trip coordinator has the authority to exclude someone from joining a trip, or running a rapid even if the paddler believes they are up it. The decisions of the trip coordinators are final.</p>
		<p>F) Trip Coordinator Responsibility: The trip coordinator makes sure that there is adequate group safety equipment (throw ropes, breakdown paddle, first aid kit), and that a trip sheet is property filled out before departure. At the put-in, the trip coordinators should quickly assess the paddling level and experience of each paddler, and arrange for pre-river briefing as is appropriate. On the river, the trip coordinator, or an experienced paddler designated by the coordinator, should keep a look out for the weaker paddlers, providing skills instruction and information on specific rapids as needed. The trip coordinator may designate other experienced paddlers in the group to assist with instruction, and may, when appropriate, designate a single sweep boat. This sweep boat is generally the last one down a rapid, and provides rescue assistance. The coordinator works to maintain group safety by trying to assist boaters in acting responsibly (see <a href="#ww_team_safety">Part 3, Team Safety</a>).</p>
		<p><a name="ww_equipment"></a>Part 2: Equipment</p>
		<p>A) Personal Safety Equipment: Each trip member is responsible for making sure that they have all the appropriate equipment, and that it is in good working order. If you find broken or damaged gear in the clubroom, put it in the to-be-repaired bin. For a river trip, each paddler must have a helmet<strong>, </strong>PFD, and suitable body wear (e.g., wet suits, dry suits, warm clothing). These items are essential. Thus, without them you may not run the river. Each paddler is responsible to assure that these items are appropriately marked on the trip sheet, either designated as club or personal gear.</p>
		<p>B) Boat Equipment: Adequate flotation, as defined by paddler experience and type of boat, is needed in all boats that are taken on the river. Decked boats require at least two stern float bags, with possibly two additional float bags for the bow. Open canoes require bow and stem bags, with an optional middle bag. Check bags for leaks prior to departure from the WAC. Each kayaker should check their boat to ensure that the foot pegs can be properly adjusted, and that there is appropriate padding for a good fit. Each paddler is responsible for signing out his or her equipment on the trip sheet. Identify boats by number and briefly describe paddles and other equipment.</p>
		<h4><a name="ww_team_safety"></a>Part 3: Team Safety</h4>
		<p>A) Upstream Right of Way: The boat in the current (typically the upstream boat) has the right of way on the river. For example, a boater playing in a hole at the bottom of a drop should yield to upstream boaters approaching the drop. Also, when you eddy out, be aware of upstream boaters who may need to use that eddy. If necessary, exit it soon enough so that the upstream boaters can be aware of its availability and paddle to it.</p>
		<p>B) Communication: Communicating on the river may be difficult over the roar of the water and as a result of the distance between the top and bottom of a particular rapid. Standard paddle signals have been developed to ease communication. Stop is indicated by a horizontal paddle raised over the head. Eddy out immediately and wait for further information. An emergency is indicated by a waving vertical paddle. A stationary vertical paddle indicates that it is safe to proceed. The paddle may be pointed slightly to one side or the other indicating the recommended direction or side of the river to be on while going down the rapid. When giving verbal instructions, state directions or places to go, and not what or where to avoid, unless you are certain that people receiving the information can clearly hear the qualifiers (generally only during discussion on shore).</p>
		<p>C) Following: Often, a less experienced paddler, because of unfamiliarity with a stretch of river or less-developed river reading skills, will want to follow another boater down a rapid. The less experienced paddler must make an explicit agreement with the more experienced paddler so that the leading paddler is aware that someone is following. Otherwise, the more experienced paddler might inadvertently lead the other into a difficult situation, or to a play spot the less experienced paddler had no intention of going.</p>
		<p>D) Boat Spacing: Experience will teach a paddler the appropriate spacing on the river. The spacing will vary depending on the river flow rate, width of the river channel, presence of eddies, and skill level of the boaters. Use eddies to reestablish proper spacing between boats when they get too close. Spacing that is too great makes signaling for help difficult in an emergency. Following too close can result in spearings or collisions when the lead boat is caught in or slowed down by holes. When closely approaching and overtaking another boat, be sure to give a shout, alerting the other boater to your presence.</p>
		<p>E) Keep Count of Upstream Boaters: Make frequent counts of the number of boaters in your group, noting the number of boaters upstream of you, and those that are downstream.&nbsp; Loosely following some order of proceeding down drops, which is either assigned or evolves, may help prevent straggling behind or unnoticed accidents. If the trip coordinator has designated a lead boat and a sweep boat, it is advantageous for all paddlers to respect, to the extent that a paddler is able to under a given situation, these positions of first and last down the river.</p>
		<p>F) Spearing: Watch your bow point when entering an eddy occupied by another boater. Enter occupied eddies under control and only if there is room.</p>
		<p>G) Occupying an Eddy: If a second boat is about to enter your eddy, make room or signal that there is not enough room for another boat. Draw strokes can be helpful in maintaining your position in an eddy.</p>
		<p>H) &quot;Hole Etiquette:&quot; Respect the order of boats lined up for a play hole or wave. Signal and watch for acknowledgment when lines form on both sides of the river above or below a play hole. If two boats unintentionally enter a hole at the same time, practice defensive boating and yield. At the very least, communicate loudly with the other boater (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;on your right&quot;).</p>
		<p>I) Scouting: Scouting rapids is required when the trip coordinator deems it necessary. Individuals may want to do additional scouting. Notify others when you alone hold up for scouting.</p>
		<p>J) Swimmers: If a person swims, first go after the boater. If the rescue of the swimmer is under control, then chase down whatever equipment may be floating around. Do not let the swimmer or the floating gear distract you from the fact that you are still on a river. Remember to look downstream, and plan your route. Do not endanger yourself or complicate the situation by attempting a rescue in a rapid where you are not comfortable. If you are not involved in the rescue process, then eddy out where possible and wait for everyone to re-group.</p>
		<p>K) Rescuing a Swimmer: (Boat Rescue) In rescuing a swimmer, it is best to approach from the upstream side with your stem towards the swimmer. The swimmer should be upstream of the loose boat, holding that boat's grab loop and paddle with one hand and reaching for the rescue boat's stem grab loop with the other hand. The swimmer should never stick fingers or hands through the grab loop due to the risk of breaking fingers or entrapping the hand. Attempt to get the swimmer to the side quickly, but take the time to look ahead and plan your route. Find a good eddy that you can reasonably get to. Remember that it will be a lot harder to make eddies with extra weight dragging on the back of your boat. The swimmer should frog kick or side stroke kick to assist the rescuer. Try to keep your swimmer calm. Talk to the swimmer when possible, but remember that communication is difficult in the roar of the water. Sometimes it is best to just have them hold on and rest until you get to the bottom of the rapid, and then paddle and swim (do not let them forget to help you by kicking) to the side. The rescuer may tell the swimmer to let go of the rescue boat grab loop if a serious drop is approaching that cannot be avoided. The swimmer must let go to avoid being speared by the rescue boat and to allow the rescue boat to maneuver in the rapid before repeating an attempt at rescue. The rescuer may request that the swimmer let go of the loose boat to better assure the swimmer's swift rescue. This may be advantageous if there are other paddlers available to retrieve the boat.</p>
		<p>L) Rescuing a Swimmer: (Shore Rescue) A swimmer may be rescued from shore with the use of a throw rope. People practiced in the techniques of using a throw rope, may be placed at strategic locations in or below difficult rapids. These people wait on shore with a throw rope ready in hand and watch for swimmers needing assistance.</p>
		<p>M) Rescuing a Pinned or Entrapped Boater: A boat that is 'pinned' is stuck in a stationary position on the upstream side of a log, rock, or other immobile object in the river. The force of the water compresses the boat against the obstruction. An entrapped boater is a person caught in the pinned boat. This can occur when the force of the water bends the boat downstream of the object, wrapping the boater's legs. Entrapment may also occur when a swimmer's foot is wedged between rocks on the river bottom, or is caught on a submerged tree branch. The rescue of such a person can involve a complicated series of maneuvers. The designated trip coordinator acts as the rescue coordinator or assigns this duty to an appropriate person. The situation should be assessed and the most appropriate action to take determined. The type of action will be based upon the victim's condition which should be addressed first, and the extent of risk to the rescuers. To learn river rescue techniques, you are encouraged to read various books and take classes on the subject. The club has several books and videos that are available for check out, most notably, 'River Rescue'. River safety manuals published by the American Canoe Association are also available for reading. The club organizes rescue practice sessions and review of techniques. It is advised to discuss and practice rescue techniques as often as is practical.</p>
		<p>N) Briefing at Put In: The trip coordinator should determine the need and extent of any briefing before paddling the river. Paddle signals, river conditions and boat order for proceeding down drops may be briefly reviewed at the put-in. Basic personal safety (<i>e.g.</i> how to safely swim and be rescued) and basic river reading and terminology (<i>e.g.</i> rocks, eddies, current) should be discussed with beginners, especially those who have not previously been on a UKC river trip. Basic whitewater techniques (how to avoid flipping, moving in and out of current) may also be discussed with beginners on shore, or at appropriate places on the river. It is the responsibility of each paddler to ask any questions, or raise any issues about the river conditions that might put into question a boater's ability or comfort in paddling the proposed stretch of river.</p>
		<p>O) Order, Eager Beavers and Stragglers: Do not straggle behind; keep up with the group. Respect order in passing down drops: usually, the trip coordinator first and if designated, the &quot;sweep&quot; boat last. The sweep should carry a breakdown paddle and a throw rope. Should the group become spread out over a long rapid, a less experienced boater should make an effort to stay nearby one or more boaters.</p>
		<p>P) Wait Up for Stragglers: If you are the second to the last boater and the last boater does lag behind (straggler, emptying boat, cramps or anything), hold up in an eddy and wait. Signal others downstream of you to wait up.</p>
		<p>Q) Buddy Support: Be supportive of learning and intimidated boaters.</p>
		<p>R) Speak Up About Safety: If you observe unsafe activities or procedures, you contribute to continuing the lack of safety by &quot;keeping it to yourself&quot;. Confront the person acting unsafely or at least speak with the trip coordinator.</p>
		<h4><a name="ww_personal_safety"></a>Part 4: Personal Safety</h4>
		<p>A) Too Much, Too Fast: Boating a river, and the individual rapids on that river, is ultimately a personal decision, not a group decision. Ask yourself if you are willing to cope with the water if things do not go well. If your boating becomes primarily a constant test of guts, you are probably biting off too much too fast. No matter how strong the group or coordinators, you are alone in your boat. In whitewater boating, bigger may not be better. Ask yourself who you are trying to impress.</p>
		<p>B) River Choice for Users of Club Equipment: For those using club equipment, your choice of river difficulty has implications for not only your safety but the club's survival as well. Consequently, for users of club equipment, river choice must be more conservative than if private equipment were used.</p>
		<p>C) Strainers: A strainer is anything in the river that lets water pass through, but will not let a boat pass, for example, a partially submerged tree. The force of the river that holds you against a strainer is incredibly strong. Strainers are much more dangerous than rocks in the river, since the current always flows around the rock and may push your boat with it. Stay well away from any strainer if at all possible. Be aware of river conditions in which strainers may be created: narrow river channels, previous storm or flooding conditions. When paddling with a watchful eye, strainers are often easily spotted and avoided. If you do wash up against one, LEAN DOWNSTREAM QUICKLY onto the obstruction or strainer. Then signal for help. With help at hand, attempt to work yourself to clear water. Wet escaping from your boat when pinned may be necessary but this is a LAST resort. Popping the spray-skirt and filling the boat with water will usually increase the possibility of entrapment in the boat.</p>
		<p>D) Rock and Headwall Rolls: Often found on tight rivers, a wall is a steep section of riverbank where the river runs head-on into it. Paddle clear of headwalls, providing enough space to not allow the current to push the boat into it. Flipping upstream of a headwall is to be avoided, but may happen. Rolling up against a headwall or rock is a tough act, but rolling up to the downstream side is the way to go. The downstream side will be the rock side. Using your paddle may be awkward in such cases. Climb up the rock or wall with your hands to a downstream lean position and move yourself to safety. To repeat, the best safety tip concerning head walls is to avoid them. Undercut headwalls can be deathly serious, in which you may need to swim straight down and then out, hoping to get washed out by the current.</p>
		<p>E) Whirlpools: Getting set up for a roll when capsized in a whirlpool is not a simple task. Moving the paddle around under water becomes very difficult. The downstream edge of your boat is constantly changing and is found more by chance than anything else. Observation of whirlpools will show, though, that they dissipate and periodically reform. Thus, the best strategy is often to wait, hoping to get washed out or to roll during a momentary canning of the water.</p>
		<p>F) Variable River Difficulty. Flow levels and water and air temperatures affect the difficulty of a particular run. A particular rapid at a low flow rate can increase in difficulty by one or more class level ratings at higher water levels, when the water may be more 'pushy' and the consequences of a paddling mistake may be quite serious. Colder temperatures can increase paddler fatigue and exhaustion, especially in the case of a swim.</p>
		<p>G) Swimming: In a swim, keep your FEET UP high near the surface of the water, AND DOWNSTREAM. Never walk on the bottom, crawl out of the river when you are in slow flowing, shallow water near the bank. The danger in moving water is pinning a foot between rocks and getting knocked over by the current. You may have the strength to hold yourself out of the water for a few moments, however, your body will relax with your head under water in the &quot;resting&quot; position. When swimming, try to hold onto all of your equipment, but if your safety is in question, then let go of it. Stay upstream of your boat if possible. Always be looking ahead to avoid possible entrapment situations. You can often use a backstroke or sidestroke to swim to an eddy or to shore. At times, you may want to wait until the end of the rapid before trying to get to shore. In that case, the best strategy may be to conserve your body heat and strength by simply wrapping your arms around your chest and floating down stream keeping yourself as relaxed as possible. Let your fellow paddlers come to you. If you are passing through rough water, relax and concentrate on the timing of a good breath of air when one becomes available.</p>
		<p>While swimming in rough water, you may find yourself approaching a hole or reversal. Letting go of your boat when trapped in a large reversal may be necessary, although often you will wash through holes created by reversals. Generally, letting go of your paddle when you are stuck in a reversal is not a good idea. This is a controversial subject. However, letting go of your paddle when in a strong reversal leaves you helpless like a cork. The only option then may be to swim toward the bottom of the hole in an attempt to catch a downstream flowing jet of water. Keeping your paddle may help you catch such a jet more easily or may help you in working out the side of the hole.</p>
		<p>When a paddler approaches you for a rescue, listen to their instructions. Grab the stern (back) loop on the rescue boat as soon as possible, and always without putting either your fingers or hand through the loop. The goal is to get you out of the water as quickly as possible without compromising either your or the rescuer's safety. Assist the rescuer by kicking, and by letting go of either your boat or theirs when told to do so. A swimmer may also be rescued with the use of a throw rope. If a rope is tossed to you, grab the bag, knot or whatever is on the rope-end as quickly as possible. Hold the rope with it on your chest, so that you are floating on your back with your feet up. This is the safest position to be pulled over the water, because an air pocket is created by the head. Should the rope become caught, and your safety placed in danger, let it go immediately.</p>
		<p>H) Paddling in Holes: Many holes and small reversals can be 'punched' by paddling very strongly and swiftly through it. However, all boaters find themselves caught in a hole at sometime or another. Lean downstream and onto a brace. The pillow of water formed by the reversal hydraulic will support a pretty heavy brace or roll sweep stoke. In most situations staying in your boat when you flip over in a hole is a good choice as rolling up onto a downstream brace on the reversal wave is not as difficult as it may appear to be. Rolling up onto the upstream side of the hole is difficult and unstable. If the downstream side is your offside and you do not yet have the offside roll, try putting the paddle out at right angles to the, boat to the downstream side. The surface current may catch your paddle and roll you up. The undercurrent may also catch the body of an overturned paddler and push both paddler and boat out of the hole to calmer water where rolling on either side would be effective.</p>
		<p>There is the choice of bracing or rolling when you are tipped in a hole, and it is worthwhile to realize that awkward and shoulder-damaging braces occur very easily. Do not extend your arm back behind the plane of your body or over your head. Rather than struggle with an overextended brace, drop into the roll position and see how easily you will roll up. Once upright with a delicately balanced downstream lean (not usually an extreme downstream lean) the next step is to work your boat toward one end of the hole where it will push either your stem or bow out. This is accomplished with sculling strokes.</p>
		<p>Advanced boaters may purposefully drop into a hole for practice or for play. Note that in riding a hole, very little bracing may be required. The key is to move your boat with subtle hip action feeling yourself actually sitting on (or slightly upstream of) the whitewater crest of the surfing wave, weight slightly shifted in a downstream lean, with the trunk of your body as upright and vertical as comfortable. Quick moves to cut back laterally across the face of the wave are made most easily by first riding up on the wave crest so that it is right beneath your buttocks and the bow and stem points are clear (or nearly clear) of the water.</p>
		<p>I) First Aid and CPR: Learn or refresh your understanding of first aid and CPR. The University of Washington/IMA and the Red Cross have regularly scheduled classes, and in the past the club has occasionally sponsored classes as well. All paddlers are encouraged to have current basic first aid and CPR certifications.</p>
		<p>J) Physical Fitness: Generally good physical conditioning supplemented with some weight work can prevent many injuries, particularly shoulder injuries. Consult books and articles (some relevant articles are kept in the club 'library') which discuss appropriate muscle development and exercise. Lake paddling is a good tune-up for a river trip if you have been away from the sport a while, and an opportunity to develop proper paddling technique. The way you paddle can go a long way towards reducing the danger of shoulder dislocation. Avoid any motion that puts your arm up and to the back relative to the trunk of the body. Keep your elbows low. In particular, learn to use the low brace (using the backside of the paddle kept below shoulder level) as much as possible.</p>

		<p>A) Skills and Equipment: The skills and equipment required for safe ocean touring have considerable overlap with those required for whitewater boating, but there are some important differences. The following discussion, though not exhaustive, gives some examples of these differences.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Equipment: Sea kayaks are designed for efficient travel in a straight line, not for ease of turning. They are also designed with load carrying ability in mind. To accommodate the higher speed at which a sea kayak is generally paddled and need to stow gear in the boat, the sea kayak paddle is longer than a whitewater paddle. Sea kayakers need to dress for cold water immersion, but this must often be balanced with the likelihood of a capsize and the expected air temperatures, since overheating can be a problem in the warm months. When in doubt, the sea kayaker should dress for cold water immersion, since it can be very difficult to put on clothing if the conditions get difficult. Sea kayakers need some means of stabilizing their boat for reentry after a capsize and wet exit. This is one of the most important differences from whitewater kayaking, since whitewater kayakers almost never need to reenter their boats in the water after a wet exit.
			<li>Skills: Since sea kayakers may find themselves far from shore, it is extremely important that the sea kayaker know how to recover from a capsize and wet exit. On a river, rescue from shore is often a possibility, and it is often the case that the capsized paddler washes out of the difficult spot into easier conditions. On the ocean, the conditions which caused a capsize will often be there after the capsize, and may not lessen for hours or even days. River kayakers often paddle in conditions which test their limits, with the result that they often practice their roll in realistic conditions. Sea kayakers may only rarely encounter conditions which test their limits, with the result that their roll is seldom practiced in realistic conditions. The result is that many sea kayakers do not have reliable rolling skills. When they do encounter conditions which test their limits, the situation is generally quite dangerous, since the consequences of a capsize in conditions near the limits of a paddler's ability may be severe. For this reason, although proficiency in the eskimo roll is strongly encouraged, it is not sufficient. Sea kayakers need to know how to recover unassisted from a capsize and wet exit, without going ashore. They also need to be familiar with techniques for assisting another kayakers to reenter their boat after a wet exit.
		</ol>
		<p>B) Classification of Sea Kayak Trips: Classification of ocean trips is somewhat different than classification of river trips. For example, the expected difficulty of a river is usually well defined if the flow rate is known. On the ocean, this is not usually the case, since conditions on the ocean are very strongly influenced by the weather conditions encountered. The same stretch of water can be flat calm and glassy smooth one day and a maelstrom the next. In fact, the change can occur within minutes or even seconds. For this reason it is difficult to rate ocean trips in the same way that river trips are rated. The ratings given to an ocean trip must consider the potential for hazardous conditions, and the difficulty of escaping from them if they occur. The UKC uses the following rating system.</p>

		<p class="Body">Paddling speed: Trip announcements will include an estimate of the planned paddling speed for the trip. Slow = about 2 knots; Medium = 2.5-3.5 knots; Fast = over 3.5 knots.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>SK II trips are suitable for beginners who have some experience paddling in the lake. One may expect slightly rougher conditions for SK II+ trips. SK II+ trips are suitable for advanced beginners, usually those who have paddled on an SK II trip or two and can control their boat in light to moderate wind (5-10 knots) and small waves (~1 foot). As usual, the number of novice paddlers will depend on an appropriate number of experienced paddlers. Paddlers must have practiced re-entry techniques for any type of SK II trip and should be comfortable paddling approximately 10 miles without assisting winds or current.
			<li>SK III trips are suitable for intermediate paddlers. It is advisable that paddlers have previous SK II experience. For an SK III trip, a paddler should be able to control their boat in moderate wind (~10 knots), handle small wind waves (1-2 feet), paddle at the designated trip speed. SK III trips are usually longer and require more endurance than SK II trips. The ability to paddle 15 or more miles a day, preferably over several days, is recommended. Paddlers must have practiced re-entry techniques and the conditions may require bracing.
			<li>SK IV trips are suitable for advanced paddlers who have experience with steep wind waves, strong wind (~15 knots), paddling in strong currents, and crossing strong eddylines. Paddlers should be experienced paddling in rough conditions and have considerable stamina. Although it is not required, the river is one of the best places to develop rough water skills, including a brace and combat roll. In addition to re-entry techniques, conditions may require anticipatory leaning, reflexive bracing, using the paddle to stern rudder, and the ability to read moving water.
		</ol>
		<p class="Body">This rating system gives a good idea of the skill level needed for a kayaker to go on a trip without more experienced companions. The presence of more experienced companions with good judgment can allow a relatively inexperienced paddler to participate safely in a trip, even though the rating system might indicate that the trip is &atilde;too difficult&auml;. A general guideline might be that inexperienced paddlers should be paired with experienced paddlers on trips in the moderate to exposed categories. Such considerations are the responsibility of the trip coordinator, and depending on anticipated weather or other conditions, the trip coordinator may decide that a person's experience is inadequate for a planned trip. The trip coordinator may also decide the anticipated conditions allow a relatively inexperienced paddler to undertake a more advanced trip. In making this judgment, the trip coordinator should take into consideration the expected weather, time of year (off season should indicate greater caution), overall strength of the party, and other factors such as the physical condition and stamina of the paddler.</p>
		<p><a name="sea_plan"></a><strong>Part 2: Planning a Trip</strong></p>
		<p>A) A minimum of three boaters per trip is required with at least one person chosen as the trip coordinator. The trip coordinator must be either a person listed on the ocean touring coordinator list (see Section III and the Sea Trip Coordinators List) or a person approved by the president or knowledgeable club member designated by the president or SK trip review committee on a case-by-case, prior approval basis. Factors which will be considered in such cases include the experience of the trip coordinator, the rating of the proposed trip, the expected weather conditions, whether or not the trip is planned during the off season, and overall group experience.</p>
		<p>B) Signing out the ocean touring kayaks (or any other club equipment) for more than three days is allowed only with permission from the president or equipment manager.</p>
		<p>C) Selecting a Destination: In addition, the weather forecast, predicted tide current strength and other related factors should be considered in relation to the abilities of the participants. Current marine forecasts can be obtained by using a weather radio designed to receive the continuous broadcasts of NOAA. Marine forecasts are also available by calling Weather Service Forecast and Administration at 526-6087. Tides and tide current information can be obtained from any of several published tide tables. The level of the tide is usually not as important as the current, so use a table which includes current information. The club web site has a page of weather links to some online weather and tide information.</p>
		<p>D) Trip Check Sheet: Prior to going on a trip a trip coordinator will submit a check sheet by email to the trip review committee (Part 5) The check sheet shall include information on the route, fetch distances, crossing lengths, alternate routes, time of max currents and slack, the flow of the maximum currents, and any known hazards.</p>
		<p>E) Trip Size: There is at least one trip coordinator per trip. A large party may, however, be broken up into smaller groups each with its own trip coordinator. Very large parties of 15 or more paddlers are discouraged due to the difficulties of organizing so many people, but the trip size is limited only by what the trip coordinator feels is appropriate for the current trip.</p>
		<p>F) Trip Coordinator Authority: The trip coordinator has the authority to exclude someone from a trip if in the coordinator's judgment, that person cannot safely participate.</p>
		<p>G) Trip Coordinator Responsibilities: The trip coordinator makes sure there is adequate group safety equipment, and that a trip sheet is properly filled out before departure. The trip coordinator is responsible for briefing people on basic safety and conditions particular to the excursion as appropriate, and for providing instruction as needed. Additional responsibilities include obtaining a current marine weather forecast for the trip location, reassessing the conditions on arrival at the put in and canceling or changing the destination if conditions warrant. The trip coordinator should be aware of the abilities and comfort levels of the other members of the trip. If the conditions make any member of the party uncomfortable, appropriate action should be taken to prevent the situation from becoming dangerous. This might include returning to the starting place if possible, or simply getting ashore.</p>
		<h4><a name="sea_equipment"></a>Part 3: Equipment</h4>
		<p>A) Ocean Touring Safety Pack: The trip coordinator is responsible for bringing a safety pack containing:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Emergency signaling devices, such as flares
			<li>Compass and up-to-date chart of area
			<li>Breakdown paddle
			<li>Towline
			<li>Repair kit for minor repairs (day trip) or more major repairs (extended trip)
			<li>Basic first aid kit
			<li>A VHF radio is recommended for SKIII or higher trips.
		</ol>
		<p>B) Individual Equipment: Each trip participant is responsible for making sure they have the following equipment and that it is in good repair.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Adequate flotation in both ends of their boat.
			<li>Approved Personal Floatation Device (PFD)
			<li>Paddle
			<li>Sprayskirt
			<li>Capsize recovery gear: Paddle float, deck rigging for paddle float rescue, bilge pump.
			<li>Whistle attached to PFD
			<li>Emergency signaling devices such as flares.
			<li>Wet suit or dry suit and paddling jacket. May or may not be worn depending on conditions. Trip coordinator may require these be worn.
			<li>Adequate clothing, including a hat for sun or cold protection, gloves or pogies, sweater, wading footgear, and dry clothing for use in the event of a capsize.
			<li>Enough water. Water is often not available at destinations.
			<li>Lunch or other appropriate food
			<li>Sea sock. Required for a boat without one or more bulkheads when the corresponding float bags are not in use or are not secured in place. May be required, at the trip coordinator's discretion, for other boats on exposed paddles.
			<li>Waterproof bags for storing any items which must stay dry, such as spare clothing. An inexpensive system is to put things into two layers of plastic garbage bags, and enclose this in a cloth bag to protect the plastic bags from tearing and punctures. Dry bags are a more expensive but more convenient and robust alternative.
		</ol>
		<p><a name="sea_safety"></a><strong>Part 4: Group and Individual Safety</strong></p>
		<p>A) General Ocean Touring Safety: Safe ocean touring requires several different types of skills. Randel Washburne, in his book &quot;The Coastal Kayaker's Manual&quot; describes four concentric rings of defense.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The outermost ring involves avoiding trouble in the first place, by learning about the way tide currents, weather conditions and other factors affect paddling conditions. Also included in this ring of defense would be learning how to see dangerous conditions in time to avoid them. A tide rip, if seen in time, can often be avoided by paddling in the correct direction. Pre-trip planning will indicate the best times to traverse areas with particularly strong tide currents. A study of the local weather patterns can allow the anticipation of strong afternoon winds in areas where heating of the land produces them. Since this outermost ring allows the paddler to avoid trouble in the first place, it should not be neglected in favor of the inner three.
			<li>If the outermost ring fails (or you like to paddle in rough conditions), the next ring involves capsize avoidance in rough conditions. The important skills in this ring of defense are the boat handling skills common to all kayaking: bracing, handling waves, wind etc. These skills should be practiced by all kayakers. Whitewater boaters routinely paddle in conditions which require them to practice capsize avoidance skills. Since sea kayakers often do not, they should form a habit of practicing bracing skills whenever they paddle. A solid reflexive brace is one of the best capsize prevention skills a sea kayaker can posses. Even better is to practice in rough conditions in a safe location so that the reflexive bracing skills are tested by real conditions.
			<li>The next ring of defense involves recovery from a capsize. By far the best method for this is the eskimo roll. No other capsize recovery method is as rapid. It is important to realize that them may be conditions under which an eskimo roll fails. In such circumstances, it is imperative to be able to perform some other method of capsize recovery. A point worth stressing is that the paddler will be much more likely to succeed in reentering a kayak if dressed for immersion in the anticipated water temperatures.
			<li>The final ring of defense involves signaling for help. Needless to say, if a situation gets to this point, the paddler is in extreme danger. Methods for attracting potential rescuers involve signaling devices, such as flares and marine VHF radios. Depending on the location, and difficulty of the trip, any or all of these methods might be used. As an absolute minimum, a kayaker should carry flares on any trip. Without such aids it can be extremely difficult or impossible to attract attention since a kayak is small and not easily seen, especially in the conditions under which an accident is most likely to occur.
		</ol>
		<p>B) Group Management Guidelines: A number of procedures should be agreed on for travel in a group. The trip coordinator should discuss these with all trip participants.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The group should stay together. If paddlers are of widely different strength, the slower paddlers should not be left behind to fend for themselves. Depending on conditions, a &atilde;fast&auml; and &atilde;slow&auml; group might be allowable, but there must be a clear understanding of the route and planned meeting place by all involved. In adverse conditions, it is important that the whole group stay within voice communication distance. It can be extremely difficult to regroup if a party is separated without a clear meeting place arranged. In a large group, pairing experienced with inexperienced paddlers will help to keep the group together, and provide the less experienced with assistance if difficult conditions arise.
			<li>The day's plans should be discussed before departure. The trip coordinator should take advantage of this to help less experienced participants learn about pre-trip planning. Contingency plans should be discussed, so that a minimum of discussion is necessary if the contingency plan is needed.
			<li>A set of signals should be understood by all members of the party. Visual signals are those of the American Whitewater Association: STOP is indicated by holding the paddle horizontally over the head, and moving it up and down. HELP or EMERGENCY is signaled by holding the paddle vertically and waving it from side to side. COME AHEAD is indicated by holding the paddle vertically, without waving it. If a particular course is to be indicated, the paddle should lean toward the desired course (this might be used in directing someone through surf, for example).
			<li>All group decisions need to be made with the experience and ability of the weakest member of the party in mind. Experienced paddlers should remember that conditions which seem easy to them may well cause an inexperienced paddler to capsize. All kayakers would do well to remember that a capsize situation is much more serious in the ocean than it usually is on a river or lake. On the ocean, the option of taking the swimmer ashore is rarely feasible.
		</ol>
		<h4><a name="sea_review"></a><strong>Part 5: SK Trip Review Committee</strong></h4>
		<p><span>The trip review committee is t</span>o be composed of all SKIII trip leaders and above for the purpose of reviewing trip sheets submitted by any leader of an upcoming trip. Trip sheets should be submitted well in advance to allow proper review and discussion, particularly for SKIII level trips and above. All current leaders (III and above) will be placed on the list unless they indicate a desire not to be a part of this process (this will include leaders who have been approved and advance to SKIII; in other words, they will be automatically added to the list upon advancement unless they express the desire not to partake). If there are suggestions a trip review member would like to make to point out trouble spots or describe encounters that one has had regarding the proposed route, people involved, <i><span>etc.</span></i>, the suggestions should be sent only to the trip leader and not to the entire trip review committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> If a member of the trip review committee has a problem regarding the proposed trip, that member should email these concerns to the coordinator and the rest of the trip review committee for discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> If these concerns are considered substantial by a majority of other committee members who have taken the time to review the proposed trip in some detail, then modifications of the trip may be required, <span>such as</span> re-routing, shortening, adding experienced people, <i><span>etc.</span></i> This would ultimately be decided upon by the safety committee.<span> </span>NOTE: There is never a desire to prevent a proposed trip from happening, only that it proceeds as safely as possible without too much restriction.</span></span></p>
		<h2><a name="safety_committee"></a>Section IV. Safety Committee and Trip Coordinator List</h2>
		<h4><a name="overview"></a>Safety Committee</h4>
		<p>The club has a safety committee composed of at least seven members as follows: <span>the </span>president, vice-president, treasurer<span>,</span> and equipment manager and no less than three expert paddlers.</p>
		<p>The functions of the safety committee are (this is taken from the club constitution):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To make decisions concerning the classification of the difficulty of various river runs not currently listed on the &quot;permitted rivers list&quot; that are to be added (see <a href="../ww/overview/rivers.html">club rivers list</a>).
			<li>To make additions or deletions of names to the Class I, II, III, and IV <a href="../ww/overview/coordinators.html">River</a> and <a href="../sea/UKCSea.html#seacoord">Sea</a> Trip Coordinator Lists at least each autumn quarter, preferably each quarter.
			<li>To determine penalties for members violating club rules and safety procedures<span>.</span>
			<li>To suggest to the club executive board various safety education activities that should be undertaken<span>.</span>
			<li>To periodically edit and update this document.
		</ol>
		<h4><a name="sea_coordinator"></a>Ocean Touring Trip Coordinator Requirements</h4>
		<p>For a trip coordinator at the SK-IV level:</p>
		<ol type="1" start="1">
			<li>Whitewater boating skill at the Class III level or greater is suggested, or equivalent boat handling skills in a sea kayak. Knowledge of reading whitewater is not a necessary skill for sea kayakers, but the boat handling skills required to paddle class III whitewater are a good indication of the general level of proficiency expected of an ocean touring trip coordinator.
			<li>A proficient, &quot;combat&quot; (as opposed to pool) roll is suggested. An alternate backup reentry method is required. A trip coordinator must be able to reenter a boat after a wet exit without assistance using the paddle float outrigger method or something similar.
			<li>Chart reading experience and knowledge of tides and tide currents is mandatory. The club occasionally holds training sessions to introduce club members to these and other aspects of ocean touring seamanship.
			<li>Knowledge of marine weather conditions and their effects on paddling are essential. The trip coordinator must be able to obtain marine forecasts, and know how to interpret them. An ability to interpret weather signs in the absence of a forecast is also desirable. Since this is a subjective area, it is difficult to establish an objective test of this ability. What is expected is familiarity with the signs of imminent bad weather and knowledge of appropriate tactics when faced with bad weather.
			<li>Good judgment is mandatory. In choosing names for the <a href="../sea/UKCSea.html#seacoord">Sea Kayaking Trip Coordinator List</a>, the Safety Committee will rank this criterion above all others.		</ol>
		<h4><a name="ww_coordinator"></a>Whitewater Trip Coordinator Requirements</h4>
		<p>For whitewater trips, we have a posted list of approved trip coordinators. The coordinators are explicitly ranked by the difficulty, or class, of river for a designated trip. The coordinators are chosen considering a variety of leadership qualities and paddling skills. A qualified coordinator has a balance of these abilities. At least one member of the Safety Committee will have paddled with the candidate several times in order to make an informed decision on the capabilities of the candidate.</p>
		<p>It is expected that the person be comfortable paddling at the level above the class of whitewater on which they would be coordinating trips. Important whitewater skills are boat handling, rescue techniques, water reading and river scouting. A coordinator needs to be a responsible person who will make good decisions concerning the safety of a trip. The coordinator should be sensitive to the abilities and comfort levels of less-experienced paddlers. A trip coordinator who is also a good paddling instructor is beneficial to the club.</p>
		<p>A current version of the <a href="../ww/overview/coordinators.html">WW Trip Coordinator List</a> is on the club's web site.</p>
