		<P>Kayak polo is similar to water polo. Polo players are divided into two teams. Up to five players from each team play at a time. They paddle around and try to put the ball through the goal of the opposing team.</P>
		<P>The game involves a lot of teamwork because you cannot paddle while holding onto the ball and you can only hold the ball for five seconds. While one team is passing the ball and trying to score, the other team defends their goal and tries to gain possession of the ball.</P>
		<P>A <A HREF="#rules">list of rules</A> follows if you want to know more about the specific regulations. But, don't feel like you need to know what you're doing to come down and play the game. It is fairly obvious how to play kayak polo and you can learn what you need to know at the start of a game.</P>
		<H2><A NAME="rules"></A>Rules</H2>
		<P>The Official <A HREF="http://www.canoe-polo.com/ICF-Rules/cprules.htm">International Canoe Federation Rules</A> are used by the club as a basic guideline. However, UKC polo is intended to be less competitive and more fun so the official rules are followed quite loosely.</P>
		<P>The club has a few of its own <A HREF="polo/polorules.html">polo rules</A>. The ones relating to safety are followed rigorously.</P>
		<P>There is usually someone serving as referee during kayak polo games to help keep it a safe, fun, and fair game for all.&nbsp;</P>
		<H2><A NAME="sultan"></A>Kayak Polo Sultan</H2>
