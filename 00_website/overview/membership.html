			<h2><a name="Membership"></a>Membership</h2>
All regularly enrolled UW students, and UW faculty and staff may join the UKC.&nbsp;
In addition, legal spouses of the above are also eligible for membership.&nbsp; No prior experience in kayaking is necessary to
join!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Regrettably, liability prevents alumni who are not faculty or staff from joining the club.</b>
</p>

<P><BR/><B>Additionally</B>, University of Washington Extension students, Branch Campus (Tacoma and Bothell) students, ASUW's Experimental College students, UW Alumni Association members, and the general public are not eligible for membership.</P>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There are three levels of membership: Lake, River/Sea, and
        Independent (also known as self-sufficient membership).</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Lake Membership</b> &nbsp;
              <p> $40/year</p>
              <p>Entitles a member to use club equipment on Lake Washington,
              Portage Bay, and Lake Union.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can take out a boat
              for a paddle whenever the Waterfont Activities Center (WAC) is
              open.&nbsp; The WAC's schedule varies over the course of the year,
              but it is generally open from mid-morning until dusk, seven days a
              week.&nbsp; In addition to individual paddling, there are
              occasional organized, informal lake trips.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;
			<li><b>River/Sea Membership</b>
              <p>$55/year</p>
              <p>Allows a member to use club equipment on official club river and sea kayaking
              trips as well as the lakes mentioned above.&nbsp; The club <a href="instruction.html#Instruction">runs
              trips year round</a>, though there are definite seasons for
              different kinds of paddling.&nbsp; A normal year sees whitewater
              paddles on most major rivers within a few hours drive of Seattle
              and sea kayak trips throughout Puget Sound, the San Juans, and
              southern British Columbia. River/Sea membership includes 
              membership to the American Canoe Association (ACA).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;
			<li><b>Independent Membership</b>
              <p>$10/year</p>
              <p>For people who have their own kayaking equipment and wish to participate in club
              trips or pool sessions.		</ul>
		<p>Memberships are valid from when they're established through the end of September each year, at which time they must be renewed.&nbsp;
        Members joining during summer quarter pay only half price due to the limited time remaining for boating.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p></p>
<p>In addition to the above fees, faculty, staff members, and spouses must pay a fee of
$8 per quarter for use of the Waterfront Activites Center (WAC).&nbsp;
Independent members are exempt from the WAC fees.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b>Membership Waiver Cards</b></p>
<p>Everyone must complete a member data sheet and waiver card prior to participating in club
activities.
		<p>&nbsp;<p><b>Insurance</b></p>
		<p>The Department of Recreational Sports Programs strongly recommends all sports club members have adequate accident/medical insurance coverage while participating in club activities. All
        club members are responsible for arranging their own coverage.&nbsp; Brochures on the Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan for registered UW students are available in the IMA Sports Club Office.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2><a name="How to Join"></a>How to Join</h2>
<p>Joining the University Kayak Club is easy.&nbsp; During Autumn, Winter, and
Fall Quarters, all you have to do is attend a pool session.&nbsp; <a href="instruction.html#Pool Sessions">Pool sessions</a>
are held on most Sunday mornings from 8:30AM to 11:30AM.&nbsp; During Summer Quarter,
come to a lake session instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Regardless of the season or location, at the session you will need only</p>
		<ul>
			<li>fill out a waiver card and the member data sheet
			<li>pass the swim test (wet exit from a kayak and tow it 50 yards
              while swimming)
			<li>pay your membership fee, and attend the orientation session right after the
              session
		</ul>
<p>That's all there is to it!&nbsp; The wet exit is indeed wet, so bring a swimsuit. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Check the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/announce/announce.html">announcements</a> page for a listing of dates
and times when pool and lake sessions will occur.&nbsp; For all sessions, meet
on the <b> waterfront side</b> of the Waterfront Activities Center (WAC) across from the
office where canoes are rented.&nbsp; If you're not familiar with the WAC's
location, it is circled in red at squares R18 and S18 in the maps below.&nbsp;
To get to the WAC, head to the Montlake Bridge side of the Husky Stadium and
follow parking lot E12 downhill.&nbsp; The WAC is right at the bottom of the
lot&#8212;if you don't see docks, a boat ramp, numerous sailboats, and the UW
canoe fleet, you're not in the right place.</p>
