			<h2><a name="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h2>
<img border="0" src="equipment-whitewater-boats.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="226">The club can provide nearly everything needed by members for paddling.&nbsp;
This includes
<ul>
  <li>14 single sea kayaks</li>
  <li>one double sea kayak</li>
  <li>21 whitewater kayaks</li>
  <li>whitewater and touring kayak paddles in a range of lengths, blade shapes,
    and feathers</li>
  <li>whitewater and sea kayak sprayskirts</li>
  <li>PFDs (also known as life jackets) ranging from extra small to extra large</li>
  <li>farmer john wetsuits in all manner of sizes</li>
  <li>a variety of drytops and paddling jackets</li>
  <li>helmets for whitewater and the occasional aggressive sea kayak trip</li>
  <li>paddle floats, bilge pumps, flares, whistles, and towlines for sea kayak
    trips</li>
  <li>whitewater and sea kayak float bags</li>
  <li>two C-1, one C-2, and one OC-2 canoe</li>
  <li>one downriver racer</li>
</ul>
<p><img border="0" src="equipment-wetsuits.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="261">For a typical day trip, all you'll need to bring of your own is clothes and
lunch, plus a few dollars for a driver donation if you're going on an official
club trip and aren't driving a car.&nbsp; For overnight trips, you'll need your
own sleeping bag and tent as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Before going on a whitewater trip, you may want to refer to the list of <a href="../ww/overview/personal_gear.html">things to bring on a
        whitewater trip</a>.&nbsp; For sea trips, refer to the list of <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/sea/UKCSea.html#seagear">things to take on a sea trip</a>.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The kayak club has an excellent safety record and devotes
        considerable effort to keeping club operations safe.&nbsp; Additional
        equipment is available to club trip leaders for use when leading
        official club trips, including first aid kits, throwlines, charts, deck
        compasses, and a VHF radio.</p>

		<h2><a name="Equipment Use"></a>Equipment Use</h2>
<p><b><img border="0" src="equipment-sea-paddles.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="170">
		All equipment use is restricted, without exception, to current club members.</b>&nbsp;
Club equipment <b> cannot</b> be loaned to friends or family, nor can
non-members share the double kayaks with a club member.</p>
<p>
        &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you lose or damage equipment beyond the course of normal wear and tear, you can expect you will have to replace or repair it.&nbsp;
If you notice problems with club equipment, let the club's <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/overview/officers.html">equipment
manager</a> know about them.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take a boat out on Lake Washington, this is all you need to do:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>at the WAC canoe rental window, exchange your UKC card for a club key.
			<li>open the door to the kayak room
			<li>return the key immediately after opening the door (so that others
              can access club equipment while you're paddling) and get your UKC
              card back
			<li>select your paddling gear: boat, paddle, spray skirt, PFD, float
              bags, <i>etc.</i>
			<li>fill out the yellow equipment use card <b>completely</b>; cards
              are in the box the desk next to the door
			<li>leave the equipment card out on the desk so that if someone's
              looking for a particular bit of gear, they can see that it's in
              use
			<li>go paddle!
			<li>upon returning, check out a key from the WAC again, open the
              door, and return the key
			<li>put the equipment you used away, cleaning it if necessary
			<li> date and sign your equipment use card and put in the back of
              the equipment card box with the other completed cards
		</ul>
<p>If you are paddling late in the day, be sure to return before the WAC
closes.&nbsp; If you are going to be paddling for several hours, it's wise to
check the weather forecast beforehand so you can be properly prepared.&nbsp;
Weather in Seattle is fairly predictable, but can still change suddenly if a
front is coming through.</p>

			The kayak club's equipment is used heavily, and therefore requires regular maintenance.&nbsp;
To make sure maintenance is done, and to make other improvements to club property, work parties are scheduled
regularly.&nbsp; Typically, there's one every quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an incentive for participation, those attending work parties are added to
the list of Club Saints and given priority when signing up for club trips.&nbsp;
To foster an atmosphere of conviviality, the club also supplies pizza and
beverages at work parties.&nbsp; Usually we have quite a load of fun.</p>

<h2><a name="Gasket Replacement"></a>Gasket Replacement</h2>
<img border="0" src="equipment-whitewater-stuff.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="192">
			The club owns the tools to replace the latex neck, ankle, and wrist gaskets
found in drytops, drysuits, drypants, and paddling jackets.&nbsp; These are available to repair
both club equipment and your personal gear.&nbsp; The only requirement is if you use the club tools for your own gear,
you have to replace the gaskets on something belonging to the club as well.&nbsp;
For more information, contact the club's <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/overview/officers.html">equipment
manager</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.kokatat.com/instruction2g1.htm">Instructions for replacing gaskets</a> can be found on <a href="http://www.kokatat.com">Kokotat's web site</a>.&nbsp;
Make sure you get the correct gasket for the top.&nbsp; The club owns Kokotat and Stohlquist
dry tops.&nbsp; George at <a href="http://www.kayakacademy.com/">Sea Kayak Academy</a> will sell gaskets for our tops at a club discount.</p>
