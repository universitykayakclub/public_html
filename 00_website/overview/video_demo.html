			<p><b>Developing a Strong Roll</b></p>
			<p>Everyone has a slightly different style of rolling and opinions on the right way to roll are wide and varied. As with many things in kayaking the roll that works best for you will likely depend on both your skills and the situation. While few paddlers develop a roll by their first river trip, a roll is essential to safely enjoy intermediate and advanced whitewater. While some paddlers find learning to roll frustrating, once you've mastered it you will be able to take boat control to a whole new level--you know if you tip over that you will get right back up! What once seemed like a very tippy craft becomes an incredibly versatile boat in even the most intense hydraulics. </p>

			<p><b>Bracing</b></p>
			<p>Bracing is used to keep you from flipping and enables you to manuver the boat on its side.  </p>

			<p><b>When your roll fails: a bow rescue (also known as an eskimo rescue)</b></p>
			<p>On beginner whitewater runs and in the pool the bow rescue is a very effective technique to develop. It saves you from a swim when your roll fails and gives you an easy way to get back up and try it again. Watch carefully in slow motion and note that the paddler rolls the boat up before bringing his head up. This is important with both the roll and a bow rescue.</p>
