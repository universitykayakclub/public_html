<h2><a name="Instruction"></a>Instruction</h2>
<p>Informal <a href="#Pool Sessions"> instruction and practice sessions</a> are held
at the Hec Edmunsen pool most Sunday mornings during
Autumn, Winter, and Spring Quarters. Separate evening practice sessions on Lake Washington for whitewater paddling and sea kayaking are sometimes conducted when daylight
permits during these three quarters.&nbsp; During summer quarter, pool sessions
move to Lake Washington.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinics in whitewater racing, whitewater rescue techniques, sea kayak rescue
techniques, and sea kayak trip planning are scheduled according to interest.&nbsp;
Most learning is done while on paddling trips, with experienced club members
leading trips year round.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whitewater activity depends on river volumes, which in turn depend on
    rain.&nbsp; Whitewater season generally runs from mid-fall through early
    summer,
    with both weekend and occasional weekday trips.</li>
  <li>Sea kayak trips are most common during the summer, as calm winds and good
    weather mean trips can safely be run nearly every weekend.&nbsp; Occasional
    trips are held throughout the winter as well, but are more likely to be
    cancelled due to high winds.</li>
  <li>Kayak polo games are held weekly, sometimes more often.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the <a href="../announce/announce.html">club announcements</a> for
trip and other instruction times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club maintains a library of books and videos.&nbsp; A considerable amount of kayaking information is available on-line as well. Kent Ford's <a href="http://www.performancevideo.com/eschool/">eSchool</a> is one great source of information.&nbsp; Visit the club's <a href="../library/UKCLib.html">library</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have some <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/overview/video_demo.html">video clips</a> to illustrate basic paddling skills.</p>

<h2><a name="Pool Sessions"></a>Pool Sessions</h2>
<p><img src="pool.jpg" width="300" height="120" border="2" align="right">Pool sessions are an excellent
        opportunity for all kayakers to develop skills in the comfort of a heated swimming pool. Pool sessions are typically run by a few advanced paddlers who teach skills, such as
edging and bracing, to less experienced paddlers. These sessions are a great opportunity to improve your kayaking ability and meet other club members.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>To attend a pool session meet at the WAC at 8:30AM Sunday mornings to load boats and other equipment.&nbsp;
        The sessions proper are held at the Hec Edmundson Pool from 9:00 to
        11:00, and usually end around 11:30 after all the equipment has been
        transported back to the WAC.&nbsp; Parking is available at the WAC or the Montlake Lot north of the IMA. Priority is given to people who help with the
        transportation and cleaning of boats prior to the pool session.&nbsp; As
        the number of boats taken is to pool sessions usually matches the number
        of people who arrive at 8:30 to help load equipment, you may not get into a boat if you are
        late.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It is a good idea to bring a shirt that you do not mind getting wet, which will help keep you warmer in the
        water.&nbsp; Goggles and noseplugs are also popular, as they keep water out of your eyes
        and sinuses, making learning
        hip snaps, bow rescues, bracing, and rolls more pleasant.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Note: pool sessions are not held during final exam weeks or breaks.&nbsp;
        Pool sessions are also occasionally cancelled due to special events
        which make accessing the WAC difficult.&nbsp; During the summer,
        practice sessions are held on Lake Washington instead.</p>

        support the kayak club, click here for information on <a href="poolsession.html">how to
        lead a pool session</a>.</p>

		<h2><a name="Rescue Techniques"></a>Rescue Techniques</h2>
<p><img src="rescue.jpg" width="300" height="168" border="2" align="right">UKC members also schedule occasional practice sessions for river and sea
kayak rescue techniques.&nbsp; These will be <a href="../announce/announce.html">announced</a>
when available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning rescue skills, contact the whitewater or
sea kayak tzar, as appropriate, via the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/overview/officers.html">club
officers</a> list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that successful completion of a sea kayak rescue course is <b>required</b>
prior to participating in club sea kayaking trips on Puget Sound or other areas
outside of the lake membership paddling area.&nbsp; A sea rescue course
is strongly recommended for taking sea kayaks out on the lakes as well, as
having an understanding of how to get back into a boat after accidentally
capsizing makes trips in rough water or substantial wind much safer.</p>
