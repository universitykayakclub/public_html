			<p><b><font size="+2">Membership</font></b></p>
			 <b>Who May Join: </b>All regularly enrolled UW students, and UW faculty and staff may join the UKC. In addition, legal spouses of the above are also eligible for membership. <b>Regrettably, liability prevents alumni who are not faculty or staff from joining the club.</b></div>
		<p>There are three levels of membership: Lake, River/Sea, and Self-Sufficient.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Lake Membership</b> costs $20/year and entitles a member to use club equipment -- but only on Lake Washington near the WAC.
			<li><b>River/Sea Membership</b> costs $40/year and allows a member to use club equipment on Lake Washington and on official club river and sea kayaking trips.
			<li><b>Self-Sufficient Membership</b> costs $5/year and is for members who will <em>not</em> be using club equipment but who wish to participate in club activities. This entitles a person to take advantage of pool sessions.		</ul>
		<p>Members joining at the beginning of summer quarter pay only half price due to the limited time remaining for boating.</p>
		<p>In addition to the above fees, faculty, staff members, and spouses must pay a fee of $6/quarter for use of the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ima/">Waterfront Activites Center</a> (WAC) facility use fee.</p>
		<p>Memberships are valid through the end of September each year, at which time they must be renewed.</p>
		<h4>Membership Waiver Card:</h4>
		<p>All participants <b>must</b> complete a member data sheet and a waiver card prior to participating in club activities with club equipment. Membership waiver cards are available from any club officer at the WAC clubroom.</p>
		<h4>Insurance:</h4>
		<p>The Department of Recreational Sports Programs strongly recommends that all sports club members have adequate accident/medical insurance coverage while participating in club activities. All sports club members are responsible for arranging their own coverage. Brochures on the Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan for registered UW students are available in the IMA Sports Club Office.</p>
		<hr>
		<b><font size="+2">How to Join</font></b>
		<p>Joining the UKC is easy.</p>
		<p>All you have to do is attend a sign-up session at the <a href="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~ima/IMA.WAC.html">Waterfront Activities Center</a>. During the Academic Year, these are on most Sunday mornings at 8:30 am. Sign-up sessions typically last until noon. During Summer quarter, sign-ups are usually on Tuesday evenings at 6:00 pm. Check the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/announce/announce.html">announcements</a> page for a listing of dates when pool sessions will be held.</p>
		<p>Regardless of the season or location, at the sign-up session you will need only to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>fill out a waiver card and the member data sheet
			<li>pass the swim test (wet exit from a kayak and tow the boat 50 yards)
			<li>pay your dues*, and attend the orientation session right after the pool or lake session.
		</ul>
		<p>That's all there is to it! </p>
