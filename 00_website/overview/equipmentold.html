			<p><font size="+2"><b>Equipment<br>
					</b></font>The Kayak Club can provide nearly all the essential gear needed by members for paddling. The club uses 16 plastic white water kayaks of various designs, 2 down river kayaks, 2 C-1 decked canoes, 1 C-2 decked canoe, 2 C-2 open canoes, 1 OC open canoe,
            14 plastic single sea kayaks, and a fiberglass double sea kayak. In addition, we have a supply of wet suits, life jackets, helmets, and paddles. Club equipment is stored at the WAC in the room opposite the canoe rental window.</p>
		</div>
		<p>In most cases, club members eschew rafting, but there are occasions (multi-day trips) when having a raft is a grand thing indeed.</p>
		<p>Before going on a river trip, you may want to refer to the list of <a href="../ww/overview/personal_gear.html">things to bring on a river trip.</a> For sea trips, refer to the list of <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/sea/UKCSea.html#seagear">things to take on a sea trip</a>.</p>
		<b><font size="+2">Equipment Use:</font></b><br>
		All equipment use is restricted to current club members only! Club equipment cannot be loaned to friends or family. Equipment can be used by all club members on Lake Washington any time the Waterfront Activities Center is open. (See the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ima/">W.A.C. Schedule</a>).
		<p>River/sea members can also use club equipment on <a href="http://students.washington.edu/~ukc/rules/rules.html#officialtrip">official club trips</a>.</p>
		<p>If you lose or damage equipment, you can expect that you will have to replace or repair it.</p>
		<p>Equipment checkout for use on Lake Washington:</p>
		<p>This is all you will need to do:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>At the WAC window, exchange your UKC card for a club key.
			<li>Return the key immediately after opening the door, to give others key access.
			<li>Select your paddling gear: boat, paddle, spray skirt, PFD.
			<li>Fill out the yellow equipment use card <b>completely</b>. (These are available on the desk in the clubroom.)
			<li>Go paddle!
			<li>Get the key from the WAC window to return your gear.
			<li>Pick up your UKC card when you return the key.
			<li>Upon return, date and sign the yellow card.
		</ul>
		<p><b><font size="+2">Work Parties:</font></b><br>
			
			The equipment at the UKC is used heavily, and therefore requires regular maintenance. To accomplish this, and to make other improvements to club property, work parties are scheduled routinely -- typically every quarter. As a small incentive for participation, and to foster an atmosphere of conviviality, the UKC supplies free pizza and beverages. Also, those who join-in at a work party are given priority in equipment selection. Usually we have quite a load o' fun.</p>
		<p><b><font size="+2">How to replace drysuit gaskets:</font></b><br>
			The club owns the tools to replace neck, ankle, and wrist gaskets which are available to repair club dry tops and your personal drytops. If you use the club tools for your own gear grab a top or two out of the club's repair bin. <a href="http://www.kokatat.com/instruction2g1.htm">Instructions for replacing gaskets</a> can be found on <a href="http://www.kokatat.com">Kokotat's web site</a>. Make sure you get the correct gasket for the top. The club owns Kokotat and Stohlquist tops. George at <a href="http://www.kayakacademy.com/">Sea Kayak Academy</a> will sell gaskets for our tops at a club discount.</p>
