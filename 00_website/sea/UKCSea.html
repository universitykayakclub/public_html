<h2>General Info:</h2>
<p>Club sea kayak outings are generally scheduled in advance during
Fall, Spring and Summer quarters. A mix of day trips, weekend outings,
and longer trips are scheduled. The <a href="99skv1.html">1999 Sea
Kayak Trip Schedule</a>, <a href="2000skv1.html">2000 Sea Kayak Trip
Schedule</a>, or <a href="2001skv1.html">2001 Sea Kayak Trip Schedule</a>
represent fairly typical years of club trips for sea kayakers.</p>
<p>You can learn about scheduled trips by visiting the <a
 href="announce/announce.html">announcements</a>
page, or through email using the UKC <a
 href="comm/Listserv.html">listserver</a>.
Other trips must be approved by the club president or the designated
sea kayak officer in order for club members to reserve the equipment.</p>
<p>In order for anyone to use UKC equipment on an off-campus trip it <em>must</em>
meet the official trip guidelines, as described in the <a
 href="rules/constitution.html">Club
Constitution</a>, <a
 href="rules/bylaws.html">Rules
and Customs</a>, and <a
 href="rules/safety.html">Safety
Guidelines</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least one trip coordinator, pre-approved by the club Safety
Committee for the level and type of trip considered, must be present. </li>
  <li>At least three club members (trip coordinator included) must
participate. </li>
  <li>The trip must be to a location or stretch of river that has been
pre-approved by the Safety Committee. </li>
  <li>Participants must fill out a trip sheet (in the binder on the
table in the clubroom) prior to leaving campus. </li>
  <li>Required equipment for sea trips includes at least one each of
the following:
    <ul>
      <li>first-aid kit </li>
      <li>flares </li>
      <li>bilge pump </li>
      <li>throw rope </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to contact the listed trip coordinator(s) to reserve a space
on any of the scheduled trips and to refer to the <a href="#searating">UKC
Sea Kayak Trip Rating Scale</a> for descriptions of the rating system
used in the trip descriptions. <em>You are responsible for
understanding or finding out about trip ratings, and for evaluating
your own ability to participate in a trip.</em> Participation in a <a
 href="#rescue">rescue session</a> is required for trips rated at SK-II
and above. We also strongly encourage everyone to become proficient in
CPR.</p>
<p>Due to the limited number of club boats it is MANDATORY that you
contact the trip coordinator to assure yourself of a place on the trip.
The trip coordinator will be able to answer any questions you may have
about the adequacy of your paddling experience but you should know
things like: "How far have you paddled in a day?" and " What is a
comfortable paddling speed for you?" There is a sign on the bulletin
board in club room that explains how to use the navigation buoys in
Montlake Ship Canal to check your paddling speed or ask us to host a
paddling speed workshop this summer.</p>
<p>Sign ups within the first 48 hours will be given equal preference.
The trip coordinators will give preference to those UKC members who did
not get a slot on a beginning trip from the previous month's schedule.
Ultimate selection of the members participating will be made by the
trip coordinator who must balance the experience and paddling strength
of the party for safety reasons. For SKI and SKII trips, every effort
is made to accommodate as many new paddlers as possible, usually two
thirds of the participants. For SKIII trips and above, trip
coordinators will weigh participation in the sea kayak class or other
equivalent experience, rescue practices, pool/lake sessions, and
assistance at work parties.</p>
<p>Transportation on sea trips is cooperative, and <em>all riders
should give the driver some gas money </em>Because the amount depends
on destination; ask the driver what she thinks is fair. Please do not
wait for your driver to ask you for your contribution.</p>
<p>If you are not sure about what you need to bring on a trip, you
should check the <a href="#seagear">list of stuff to bring on a sea
trip</a>. </p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="seagear"></a>What you should bring on Sea Kayaking Trips:</h2>
<p>Here is a list of items to bring on every club sea kayak trip,
including day trips and overnight trips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wool, pile or polypro sweater/shirt and pants to wear under a wet
suit. While sea kayaking, it is important to be able to adjust your
insulation to suit the conditions, so multiple layers are important. Be
prepared for a range of conditions from cold and windy to hot and calm.
It should be possible for you to add or remove layers <em>while on the
water</em>. </li>
  <li>Old sneakers you don't mind getting wet (or neoprene booties, if
you have them). Wear <em>wool</em> socks inside these, <em>not</em>
cotton! </li>
  <li>Sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat to protect you from that bright
orb in the sky. </li>
  <li>A few dollars for gas. Exactly how much depends upon the distance
of the drive, the number of riders contributing, etc. If you have
doubts, ask the driver what seems fair. (Remember, dragging boats
around also makes for a significant amount of wear and tear on a
vehicle, which can be more costly than petrol.) </li>
  <li>Food and water. (Bad things happen to dehydrated, hypothermic (or
hyperthermic) boaters.) For overnight trips, contact the trip
coordinator about possible shared food arrangements. </li>
  <li><b>Chocolate</b> for the trip coordinator(s). <em>(Extremely
Important!!!)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>For overnight trips, the gear requirements multiply.&nbsp; The club
does not own camping gear; all camping gear for overnight trips must be
provided by trip participants.&nbsp; If you'd like some advice for what
to bring on an overnight club sea kayak trip, club trip coordinator
Mike Wagenbach has written <a
 href="sea/kayakcamping.html">this
informative essay entitled, "Fundamentals of Kayak Camping Gear."</a></p>
<p> </p>
<hr> <a name="rescue"></a>
<h2>Rescue Clinics</h2>
<p>Self rescue and buddy rescue are required skills for trips rated at
SK-II and above.</p>
<p>Scheculed rescue sessions are listed on the <a
 href="announce/announce.html">announcements</a>
page and are also sent out by email using the UKC <a
 href="comm/Listserv.html">listserver</a>.
If you are interested in a scheculed sea kayaking trips and cannot make
a rescue session then you may want to contact that trip's coordinator
to see about scheduling an extra rescue session.</p>
<p>The Self Rescue and Buddy Rescue sessions involve practice on the
lake (YOU WILL GET WET!). Bring a bathing suit and some shoes that can
get wet plus a warm change of clothes. The WAC also has a sauna room
for those so inclined to use it...</p>
<p>By request, sea kayak rescue skills can be practiced at a pool
session (during fall, winter and spring quarters only). You should
contact a sea trip coordinator to ensure that someone who knows these
techniques will attend the pool session! </p>
<hr> <a name="searating"></a>
<h2>The UKC Sea Kayak Trip Rating Scale</h2>
<p>The following is a trip rating scale used by the Washington Kayak
Club's sea kayaking section to communicate the anticipated demands of a
trip.</p>
<p>Most club trips will not exceed the SK-IV classification on this
scale. It is certain that there will be no club trips that would rate
SK-VI. Ratings may be adjusted up or down by adding a + or - to the
rating to indicate an intermediate difficulty level.</p>
<p><em>Please know your abilities if you sign up for a trip rated
SK-III or higher.</em> If you have <em>any</em> question about your
capabilities, discuss them with an official UKC trip coordinator.</p>
<p>To determine how fast your comfortable pace is, you can time
yourself over the measured nautical mile course on the Evergreen Point
floating bridge. It is indicated by round red-and-white markers near
the ends of the floating part of the bridge on the <b>south</b> side.
A green-and-white marker in the middle marks the half-mile point; it is
near the draw-span. On the <b>north</b> side are two rectangular
green-and-white marks separated by 2000 meters, a distance about 8%
longer than the 1852 meters of the nautical mile. Unless you are
looking for rough conditions, you should pick whichever side of the
bridge is most protected. The conditions on the exposed side of the
bridge can be unexpectedly rough due to wave reflection from the
bridge. Caution is advised when the wind is blowing.</p>

<p><b>Paddling speed:</b> Trip announcements will include an estimate
of the planned paddling speed for the trip. Slow = 1-2 knots; Medium =
2-3.5 knots; Fast = over 3.5 knots.</p>
<p><b>Paddling Distance:</b> Trip announcements will include an
estimate of the paddling distance, in nautical miles. Trips of over 5
nm in length require previous trip experience or permission of the trip
coordinator. Participants are expected to be able to paddle the
anticipated distance at the planned paddling speed.</p>

<h2><a name="seacoord"></a>Sea Kayaking Trip Coordinators</h2>
<p>Trip coordinators with e-mail addresses can be reached with a single
message to ukc-skl_at_u.washington.edu.
Please note the differences between this address and
ukc-sea_at_u.washington.edu. Individual trip leaders can be contacted with
the email addresses in the trip coordinator list.</p>
<p>The UKC is always looking for new trip coordinators.&nbsp; Trip
coordinators should be competent paddling at one difficulty level above
the level for which they are approved to lead trips (e.g., an SK-III
trip coordinator should be at least be a competent SK-IV
paddler).&nbsp; Sea kayak trip coordinators must also possess skills in
the areas of marine navigation, marine weather, paddling safety,
leadership, survival, and wilderness first aid, commensurate to the
level of the trips they will lead.&nbsp; The UKC regularly runs
training for new and current sea kayak trip coordinators.&nbsp; For
more information, contact the current <a
 href="overview/officers.html#seatzar">Sea
Kayak Tzar/Tzarina</a>.</p>
<p>The following is a list of UKC sea kayaking trip coordinators. A
trip coordinator is authorized to take club members on trips up to the
difficulty level at which her name is listed.</p>
<p>Level 1 ('Cooperative') trip coordinators may conduct trips at or
below the indicated rating, providing all participants have previously
paddled a trip of this nature before, under similar or more difficult
conditions. Or they may help organize a trip of slightly higher
potential difficulty with a level 2 coordinator in that class or a
coordinator in a higher class.</p>
<p>Level 2 ('Instructional') trip coordinators are regarded to be
competent instructors for the indicated rating, and may conduct trips
with people who have not previously paddled a trip of this nature.</p>
