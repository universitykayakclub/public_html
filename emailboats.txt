Subject: Selling Boats

Hi Jason and Lexi,
I saw that you're selling the "good" boats on facebook marketplace. When I meet you Jason we talked about how uw rec was going to be using the boats for outdoor programs. If you are selling them and not going to using them for student whitewater trips, I know that UKC would be extremely grateful to use them for our club. I learned very recently that uw rec must generate their own revenue, so I get selling the boats to fund programs. However, that makes me sad. We can't provide any compensation for the boats (specifically the jackson listed in the fb marketplace post) besides clearing space in the locker room. But we could come by this week and move them out of your way as the post said you needed it gone asap.

Also some clarification on what the plan is for uw recreation and whitewater kayaking would help both of us because I don't want to compete against you.

Thank you,
---

Hello,

First, I want to address your comment about feeling a sense of competitiveness. UWILD does not run any trips involving whitewater, as those are considered too risky for us to manage. In that regard, there's no overlap or competition between our programs.

Second, we do have some final boats we are in the process of selling. Due to the current financial challenges facing the University of Washington, I've had to make some difficult decisions regarding departmental funding. One of those decisions is to sell these boats. As much as I would love to donate them to the kayak club, I'm not in a position to do so. At this point, I've received several inquiries from individuals and organizations willing to purchase the boats I have left, and I need to prioritize those offers.

This decision in no way reflects the value your club brings to campus. I fully recognize how important it is for students to get outside and experience the water. However, my department is expected to support the broader directive from the university, which includes ensuring our programs are financially sustainable.

I understand this isn't the outcome you were hoping for, and I genuinely appreciate your passion and advocacy. Should circumstances change in the future, I will be sure to communicate with Jason so that we can coordinate the best path forward together.
