        <h1> Fuck the WAC <img src="8.png" alt="construction man"></h1> 
        <h2>2025-06-26</h2>
        <p>I want to say that this statement does not represent UKC as a whole. These are only my thoughts as a individual.</p>
        <p>
            The WAC doesn't care about Student Organizations. They have consistently been hostile towards the UKC, and its operations.
            Yes, the UKC did store its boats in the Shell house for a long time. It wasn't until they wanted to remodel the waterfront that we were able to store our boats there.
            I can't be sure what was the force behind this remodel, but I can only conclude that it was greed by the university of washington. 
            They tried to kick out the Sailing club which was meet with a lot of push back by the community. However the kayak club did have enough momentum becuase around the same time the WAC
            suspended the club. Now the grounds for this suspention is wrong. The old manager of program operations claimed that we did not fill out insurence forms for paddles on lake washington.
            This is true, but we had never in the history of this club filled out insurence forms for lake paddles.
            I think Sam Rodenberg wanted a reason to suspend the club because he did not like it. I can only speculate because it was before my time.
            So that, covid, and most of the club being seniors meant that the club basically died. Me and a few others have tried to increase momentum, but running a club is hard.
            The biggest challenge is where to put massive whitewater kayaks in seattle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason I'm writing this is because the WAC decided to sell the boat. The year before I took over as president of the club the WAC sent numerous emails to the UKC. 
            Obviously, we didn't really have space to store the boats. So they sat at the WAC for about two years. When I took over I tried emailing them about reclaiming the boats 
            as I did have room to store them. But instead they decide to sell them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I reached out over facebook to Lexi Ryan, as that was the method they were using to advertise the boats. And she block me! Like What the fuck!?
            Then I reached out over email and she basically said that the WAC is experiencing financial challenges and she decide to sell the boats.
            Excuse the hyperbole, but that's literally stealing. I'm sorry we didn't remove the boats, but jesus christ the least you could do is understand 
            that you were the ones who suspended the rec club.
        </p>
        <p>Given all this they still have the audacity to put on their website that we organize our activities at the WAC.</p>
        <p>Fuck the waterfront activities center</p>
